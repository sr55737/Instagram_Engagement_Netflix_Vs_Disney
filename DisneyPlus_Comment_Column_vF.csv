99,CyEKIYtxEGl,This is one of my favorite movies ever made
100,Cx-6CDzLux7,How is it compared to Eddie Murphy haunted mansion
101,Cx-6CDzLux7,"I saw it in theaters!! Started rewatching it when i had a free period in school
Haunted mansion is one of my favorite rides in WDW and I loved all the references to the ride"
102,Cx-6CDzLux7,Can we get tower of terror on Disneyplus please!!
103,Cx-6CDzLux7,"Movie ruled 🔥, more people need to give it a chance"
104,Cx-6CDzLux7,It honestly gets better in the second half… Personally think the 2003 version was better…
105,Cx-6CDzLux7,Watched it tonight. We had a great time. Very entertaining. 😎
106,Cx-6CDzLux7,Im glad I got to see it in theater. This movie was a lot of fun to watch
107,Cx-6CDzLux7,Oh this movie was actually fun.
108,Cx-6CDzLux7,Didn’t like cgi at all. The original film was better
109,Cx-6CDzLux7,"Excellent film and story, but my only question is why some of the CGI looked cheap liked the hatbox ghost compared to the 2003 version? Like Madam Leota look more realistic in the original to me."
110,Cx-6CDzLux7,Owen Wilson was great in this
111,Cx-6CDzLux7,I just want it and chapter 2
112,Cx-6CDzLux7,"When I saw this is the cinema with my mother, we both enjoyed it and she immediately asked when she can watch it again, after we left the cinema! 😅 she’s waited all this time to see it again and we’re very happy it’s now on Disney+!"
113,Cx-6CDzLux7,Great movie

374,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,OK BUT HEAR ME OUT: GRAVITY FALLS LIVE ACTION SERIES??😍
375,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,this is why kpop fans get bullied
376,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,The only kpop on disney is TXT ... lets keep it that way please 😭
377,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,You guys promised not to block password sharing. Yesterday you announced you’re going to block it. We cancelled our subscription 😂
378,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,Uhm guys...I don't think you know what the L means nowadays...
379,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,"lemme guess how this ends... her asian parents reluctantly approve of her life choices & once they see how talented she is, they admit they've been wrong & give her their unconditional love & support? lol. never in a million asian households will that ever happen. at least not without constant judgement & relentless snide remarks."
380,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,"Disney is wondering why they're losing subscribers, raising prices, and are needing to reevaluate strategies, all while pushing out so much trash content 🤦‍♀️"
381,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,Not another koreaboo after that Netflix mess
382,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,Does anyone know the name of the actor next to the blond girl?
383,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,Bye not another koreaboo show😭streaming services stop making kpop fans look bad challenge
384,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,I love K-pop but this is not it 😭
385,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,Y’all didn’t learn from what Netflix did?
386,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,so yall dont upload the nct 127 show for europe but THIS💀
387,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,Not the koreaboo show
388,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,😍😍😍😍
389,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,"I represent the K-pop fandom, and we have decided to NOT claim whatever this is🤐"
390,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,I hope she chooses dentistry in the end. That could be a meaningful journey and message if done right.
391,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,it’s giving xo kitty 💀
392,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,jajaj uno de los actores estaba criticando en tiktok porque en latino América  escuchamos K-pop si no le entendemos. 😂
393,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,You guys make terrible financial decisions.
394,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,Emphasis on the L
395,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,Ay no
396,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,What koreaboo fanfic is this?
397,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,"I love K-pop. Don’t get me wrong, but I’m not gonna watch this. This looks pretty bad."

408,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,Another show jumping on Koreaboo bandwagon after that Netflix one 🤡
409,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,"People-“Disney never makes new content these days, everything is sequels and remakes”
Makes something original
People-“this is trash even though I haven’t watched it”"
410,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,Disney its not too late to turn back
411,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,"Ay no mames, se quedaron sin ideas"
412,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,Why y'all gotta make everything into cringe
413,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,WHAT IS THISSSS PLEASE
414,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,Hey Disney its around the time that the kids that grew up with tinker bell  are starting to have babies of there own so I think it’s time to take back canceling the 7th and 8th movies we need more fairy time
415,Cxs_Cm4xBiy,"Esto se ve mal , si antes me linchaban  por escuchar K-pop, cuando esto salga viene lo bueno de verdad😂, y que significa la L 🤨?"

573,Cxa2eYWRHjf,People are only saying this show is terrible because of the finale. Before everyone was saying one of top tier mcu show. Now everyone is bashing it
574,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Didn’t actually like the ending but this show wasn’t as bad as people say…
575,Cxa2eYWRHjf,"Well, I sat through She Hulks making of, I suppose I can sit through this one too."
576,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Worst marvel show
577,Cxa2eYWRHjf,yo mean how AI did It?
578,Cxa2eYWRHjf,No one’s even watching the show dawg
579,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Marvel Lovers Button >>>>
580,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Adding to my watch list. I need an explanation!
581,Cxa2eYWRHjf,"This show had the potential to be Andor level and it came crashing down hard, hell, I even enjoyed until the finale came. It’s really saddening of what it could have become, even sadder that other Marvel shows did Secret Invasion better than the actual show."
582,Cxa2eYWRHjf,I genuinely forgot this show even existed tbh
583,Cxa2eYWRHjf,what if season 2 trailer when
584,Cxa2eYWRHjf,"Unfortunately, not a fan of this series!"
585,Cxa2eYWRHjf,This is probably better that the show itself
586,Cxa2eYWRHjf,"Secret Midvasion , I wanted to like it so bad but I couldn't"
587,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Probably the first assembled I'm not interested in the slightest
588,Cxa2eYWRHjf,"This show was such a let down.. 😩
I say that as a big fan of Marvel"
589,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Why would anyone want to watch this?
590,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Very bad show...
591,Cxa2eYWRHjf,WHY DID YOU GUYS REMOVE GROUPWATCH?!?!?
592,Cxa2eYWRHjf,I’m usually very positive about the MCU but this show really was boring as hell
593,Cxa2eYWRHjf,*booing noises from the distance*
594,Cxa2eYWRHjf,They did better ending. 😢😢
595,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Worst show(((
596,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Thank you for showing us where you messed up in production 👏🔥
597,Cxa2eYWRHjf,hard pass this show sucks y’all tucked up with this one for sure
598,Cxa2eYWRHjf,"The show is terrible. Secret invasion was supposed to be this huge event. Instead, it seems so small. The storyline didn’t make sense, and the ending was atrocious. Samuel L Jackson is still Samuel L Jackson, but even he wasn’t able to save this monstrosity.  Still better than She Hulk, though."
599,Cxa2eYWRHjf,You mean the making of a dumpster fire ?
600,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Should start calling these “where it all went wrong”
601,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Wb making of gotg vol 3?
602,Cxa2eYWRHjf,3 hours 43 minutes of my life for this show....
603,Cxa2eYWRHjf,they sat down and said “how do we build up their expectations for something great at the start and then turn around and make it as terrible as possible by the end”
604,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Don’t nobody care bruh😭
605,Cxa2eYWRHjf,"Definitely watching this , considering I played a very small role in this , it would be rude not to do !
#extra #supportingactor #marvelfam"
606,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Worst series in history
607,Cxa2eYWRHjf,The show is terrible
608,Cxa2eYWRHjf,What I want to know is what’s gonna happen to every mutant and off-worlder on Earth after Ritson’s pathetic little hate speech in the last episode?
609,Cxa2eYWRHjf,JUSTICE FOR MARIA HILL
610,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Zzz
611,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Spoilers it’s just a video of a trash can fire
612,Cxa2eYWRHjf,I’d rather see it unmade.
613,Cxa2eYWRHjf,"Usually, I'm very flexible/tolerant with the ""flaws"" among the different projects of Marvel Studios, but the truth is this is the first show I actually dislike and felt deceived in a long time. It was nothing near the OG story from the comics and the element of surprise was badly managed: I didn't connect with the story.... Ohh and the ending was a total disappointment for me."
614,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Kuch bhi behenchod iska bhi making of dikhaoge😂
615,Cxa2eYWRHjf,🙌🙌🙌
616,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Behind the scenes of shit
617,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Worst marvel show by far
618,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Why??
619,Cxa2eYWRHjf,It’s just gonna be a bunch of ai shit
620,Cxa2eYWRHjf,I’m actually interested on how you made this garbage
621,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Conclusion: shat in hands and clapped @jac_wooly
622,Cxa2eYWRHjf,Aint nobody wants to shit this piece of 🐒
623,CxYiGunhf8H,That’s not my Ariel🤦🏻‍♀️😢
624,CxYiGunhf8H,Not my Ariel
625,CxYiGunhf8H,Funny.  Disney has lost its creativity in movies just like in the parks.  Sad.  IGER ruined a once magical place.
626,CxYiGunhf8H,Please stop with the remakes and changes and make some ORIGINAL content.  The stock is a big indicator on how these remakes are doing.
627,CxYiGunhf8H,"I am not a fan of the live action remakes, but I actually liked this one. It stuck mostly the source and only made a few changes while staying fun. Not like the one that looks awful coming out next year..."
628,CxYiGunhf8H,I thought I’d like this but I didn’t sadly. Prefer the original cartoon so much more. Melissa as Ursula was a great choice.
629,CxYiGunhf8H,"Scuttlebutt is the new ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" in our house 😂😂"
630,CxYiGunhf8H,Gave it a try.. not my ariel
631,CxYiGunhf8H,Where’s groupwatch!?
632,CxYiGunhf8H,Stop making shitty remakes of good movies

726,CxVzw4fJJFp,this is quite literally not the simpsons
727,CxVzw4fJJFp,End that show already. It hasn't been funny since the 90s. I don't understand why/how people still watch it tbh.

729,CxVzw4fJJFp,How in the hell do people not know that every treehouse of horror is always gonna be a reference to horror movies or shows?(is death notehorror or thriller?)

900,CxLdQ24R-V0,You know what would be a scream? Being able to stream the ORIGINAL Under Wraos movie. Give the 90s/early 2000s kids what they want
901,CxLdQ24R-V0,"Thanks again for raising the price for a fourth time without fixing any of the platform issues!! Like recording, remember where you left off, Forced commercials when we pay for no commercials, Not being able to load entire libraries of shows, Forced commercials when you already recorded the program. That kinda stuff! Hulu is the BEST!!! 
Price goes up to $90 Oct 11th! Can’t wait till you raise the price again!!! 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚"

941,CxI1hoKr65t,ADD NO WAY HOMEEEE
942,CxI1hoKr65t,"I hope they posted this video on YouTube since I can't exactly comment this on Disney Plus, it would've been way better if they actually did release Elemental a decade early, since hypothetically I can't tell where this idea of Peter's first happen and/or which Pixar films were actually bad, I mean I love Pixar, but sometimes I can tell not all movies are good.🔥💧🔥💧🔥💧🔥💧🔥💧🔥💧"
943,CxI1hoKr65t,Just finished Elemental on disney+ and That was sooooo good😍😍😍😍
944,CxI1hoKr65t,🔥

958,CxI1hoKr65t,❤️❤️❤️❤️
959,CxI1hoKr65t,"THE BEST PIXAR FILM TO DATE - we saw it at the cinema and my whole family adored it. I’m now at home right now watching with our almost 2 year old (who never sits still) and even she is entranced. 
The animation is incredible, the storyline (and real life back story) are beautiful and sentimental. It’s funny, poignant, sad and courageous. Thank you for giving this to the world - we will love this for years and years to come 🌳🔥💦🌬️"

968,CxI1hoKr65t,made me cry just like the movie. Such a special movie and story. The message and meaning is so beautiful
969,CxI1hoKr65t,"Me encanto la pelicula, llore de la emoción! Disney debería hacer más peliculas como esta en vez de hacer adaptaciones como por ejemplo.. la nueva pelicula de la sirenita que es muy mala. Elemental sigue siendo inclusiva y buena, en vez de hacer peliculas antiguas con adaptaciones deberían hacer más peliculas como esta ❤️ muy bien peter sohn!!!"
970,CxI1hoKr65t,Loveeee this movie 🥹
971,CxI1hoKr65t,"Awesome, I ended up loving this movie and it’ll be great to see the making of it. Beautiful story, music, visuals, and the characters are so deep and relatable especially Wade 🩵"

973,CxI1hoKr65t,Viciado nesses documentários! Inspirador! 👏🤩
974,CxI1hoKr65t,"Hands down might be my new favorite Pixar movie! Haven’t been this emotional since the last Toy Story. I loved it from the beg to the end. Felt like the Old Disney again and making really beautiful movies that everyone can enjoy. Thank you, my husband is first generation Persian and I am straight off the farm American Midwest. How we got together is still incredible, he was able to relate to the family story and we connected on the love story. Love to see a 2nd film where they have a little one that is a steam cloud (maybe that can create lighting (fire) and rain (water). Anyway, love love love it 🥰"

1215,Cw8D37txlEs,"good luck charlie revival

disney, you guys are missing  a golden opportunity! Good Luck, Charlie should get a new season and heres why:
With Mia Talerico entering high school, all fans went nuts and started claiming a new season that explores this phase.]
Besides Charlie, that are many narratives that can be explored. For that, all the family would be living at the house that we know and love. You may ask, how would they all be living together again? heres the expanaiton:
 Teddy would have been fired from the company where she worked, so she would be entering a new phase too. With all the adversaries of a young adult life she would be facing challenges in her love life, professional… and thats when she would go back living with the duncans “temporarily”. Charlie would be seeing her good luck, charlie videos and say that teddy should be a family vlogger and that would be a success. Thats how the essence of the show would be preserved.
Pj would have never left the place, cause why would he?In his life, He would be working as a private chef on different events and trying to find his true love and future spouse.
Gabe would be coming back home, cause he would be just graduated from university and also, he would be enjoying his youth and singleness.
Bob and Amy would be raising toby and Charlie, and facing this new pattern of raising kids with all the technology and they would be so happy that their empty nest would be full with the duncans."

1485,CwX58kjr-iV,Still wish Disney would stop cropping their older animated films from 4:3 to 16:9. Like the restoration is good but we are missing out
1486,CwX58kjr-iV,"Guys, the 2015 movie was removed because of licensing and contracts prohibiting it from being on D+"
1487,CwX58kjr-iV,Disney doesn’t realize that by replacing actors and writers with AI they are crushing the dreams of future generations. They can no long be a company that preaches “dreams come true” when they are literally giving away dream jobs to robots. Sad to see where this once great company is going.
1488,CwX58kjr-iV,No offense disney no one asked for this! I WANT THE HOUSE OF MOUSE!
1489,CwX58kjr-iV,Great! Now please put in the live action with Lily James and House of Mouse! (We’ve been asking for years!

The film's atmosphere has returned, and the detail in the lineart and backgrounds is magnificent. I know Snow White is next on the pipeline. Please keep it up for all the Animation Studios films!"
1504,CwX58kjr-iV,This restoration is absolutely stunning compared to the last abomination it received. Clearly from reading these comments the efforts have been completely lost on the wider audience but this is amazing work.

1974,CvvB-qzAJAT,Please don’t be woke❤️
1975,CvvB-qzAJAT,Please don't make Ahsoka a mary sue or a woke feminist. She's one of the best actual strong female characters. She don't need to be changed for an agenda.
1976,CvvB-qzAJAT,"So goddamn sick of the word ""woke."" I mean, I'm sure this will be another stupid barrage of identity politics and corporate analytics-driven dreck, but stop using that annoying word whenever something has a female lead. You negate credibility."

1980,CvsI50SRnzC,The character cast doesn’t make sense. I get Ariel and Snow White bc their characters are there but shouldn’t belle be there since she knows Gaston the best??? And I feel like they just put tiana there for representation which is fine but what exactly does she have to contribute?
1981,CvsI50SRnzC,Finally doing something with their Disney characters and their Disney princesses besides race whopping them and insulting them
1982,CvsI50SRnzC,"I quite wish it was the first 6 Disney princesses instead, Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, Ariel, Belle, and Jasmine 😅 (but I'd like to see Tiana with them too) I wish we could see Aurora getting some screen time since she never gets any"

1994,CvsI50SRnzC,Gaston but no Belle?
1995,CvsI50SRnzC,Atleast they are keeping the characters original and not going with the woke remakes that has confused the life out of my two kids
1996,CvsI50SRnzC,"Big mistake, Ataturk has nothing to do with any of that. He was against monarchy and ended it."

2481,CvKqiperxio,"Secret Invasion started in an AMAZING way, but the rush to resolve an issue that could be further developed ended up spoiling the series. The last episode was a fiasco, with meaningless fights. Wake up while you still have time, Marvel"
2482,CvKqiperxio,"I was looking for the excitement, but the excitement really disappeared😢"
2483,CvKqiperxio,Rhodey doesn't know  Tony is dead
2484,CvKqiperxio,Solid show but gotta say that is THE WORST ending out of all the shows. And why are the finales always so dang short
2485,CvKqiperxio,"Please, we beg you, ditch the 6-episode format, it's done nothing but hurt the potential of the shows"

2488,CvKqiperxio,Show was lukewarm hotdog water
2489,CvKqiperxio,So G’iah in 6 episodes is now probably now the 2nd strongest marvel character just probably behind Wanda.
2490,CvKqiperxio,This is trash for the final ending 😔
2491,CvKqiperxio,i love love love marvel but bro lmao HORRRRRRRIBLE ending idc if it picks back up in the marvels the ending was 0/10
2492,CvKqiperxio,Was not a fan. 4/10 No depth to any of the characters
2493,CvKqiperxio,Great show. But I really wish Marvel and DC would stop using such iconic comics to make their show and give us only 10% of that comic.
2494,CvKqiperxio,Marvel literally wasted a golden opportunity ☠️
2495,CvKqiperxio,It came down to nothing 🙄 just a rushed finale to set up for another project
2496,CvKqiperxio,Fraco demais 👎🏻

2500,CvKqiperxio,Even with the down hill truth is marvel is far greater golden style. Than reboot DC will ever be. The Rhodey reveal very good . Maybe 🤔 the real Rhodes will find a way to bring Tony back from the multiverse 😆 lol. Giah funny all powerful yet Ultron could take her lol 🤣.
2501,CvKqiperxio,So we gave a character  every power to make her God? GOOD JOB MARVEL.
2502,CvKqiperxio,"So,  giah > thor, captain marvel, doctor stranger, scarlet witch ?"
2503,CvKqiperxio,👎🏻
2504,CvKqiperxio,"N, it ends with a disappointment."
2505,CvKqiperxio,Finale was disgustingly mid
2506,CvKqiperxio,So I guess I’m the only one who liked it
2507,CvKqiperxio,Pay your writers
2508,CvKqiperxio,What a disaster.... Non sense Storyboard
2509,CvKqiperxio,The ending was a total abnormality.
2510,CvKqiperxio,please make it stop
2511,CvKqiperxio,"Awful series. Gave it time but didn’t get any better. Compared to all of the other Marvel TV series, this was by far the worst. Painful to watch at times. 

So slow, poorly written and with aimless direction. The lack of a decent script must have been so frustrating for the actors. It was like watching poor episodes of Doctor Who. 

So little made sense. Needed longer episodes to allow them to set scenes better and explain the conclusions. I’m left with so many questions, but unlike with other Marvel projects, I’m not sure I actually care. 

Only saving grace was Olivia Coleman, who was scary, bonkers and amazing."
2512,CvKqiperxio,Disappointed
2513,CvKqiperxio,I'm sorry but this show was really mediocre...
2514,CvKqiperxio,"This was just an incredible boring show, lazy writing lazy plot"
2515,CvKqiperxio,Not sure i got what this show was ultimately about? The story of the scrulls that ended in a race war with vigilante humans and fury leaving Earth again? Seemed a bit of a waste really.
2516,CvKqiperxio,"Invasion??? You waste the whole Plot , Start with Skulls vs Human and ended with Giah vs Gravik"
2517,CvKqiperxio,"All this money spent , and for what ?"
2518,CvKqiperxio,Another borefest 🥱😂
2519,CvKqiperxio,"The six episode format only worked for Loki (it worked extremely well and it’s one of the best comic book shows). Secret Invasion needed that slow burn storytelling, but unfortunately we got a rushed finale again. G’iah deserved more screen time, it just doesn’t feel right to see her get these powers all of a sudden. The show is a 7/10"
2520,CvKqiperxio,The start was so great. The end? Failed miserably. You just gave a scroll every single power we’ve seen through out years of movies and character developments in just 6 episodes like it was nothing. Another L from Marvel.
2521,CvKqiperxio,CRAP.
2522,CvKqiperxio,It was crap all the tv shows are a let down
2523,CvKqiperxio,200 million dollars to make this mediocre series. This series is a waste of time 3/10
2524,CvKqiperxio,What a lame show. 6/10. So why didn’t those enslaved people at the power plant get radiation poisoning? Gravik was easily defeated after a dramatic six episode season.
2525,CvKqiperxio,And please tell your costume designers that the suits are meant to look old and weary that makes it realistic like what you did in the show with other clothes that's my only complain with most of the phase 5. And stop the excessive detailing but also on the other side don't forget to add a little detailing find the sweet spot. They look weird.
2526,CvKqiperxio,SHE HULK / MISS MARVEL / SECRET INVASION : 🤮🤮 2/ 1O
2527,CvKqiperxio,worst mcu project
2528,CvKqiperxio,Its a shame they killed off some of the most important characters in a series like this. Talos and maria hill deserved so much more. This series was by far average at best. This was a show that from the first episode stated world war 3 but there was barely any action and if it was nearly world war 3 why isn't falcon and red guardian on the front lines for their county. For a 212 million dollar project it was quite bad.
2529,CvKqiperxio,"Y'all really blew the secret invasion? Damn, @marvelstudios films/TV is dead"

2891,CuZ8y_ivMYi,I bought a copy of that as a poster in 2004.

Now this is something new , disney creating new heroes and not just blackwashing old stuff . Finally they create something instead of handing out 2hand worn clothes ."
2937,CuX3GfbBwvb,Why do people treat Africa as some type of joke?
2938,CuX3GfbBwvb,Tired of everyone hating on every Disney project… if you’re not interested move along to whatever you’re interested in instead of taking time out your day cause you’re bored to hate on a company that will never know your name

2940,CuX3GfbBwvb,Brazilian capoeira I would love to see

2942,CuX3GfbBwvb,They all have something in common?
2943,CuX3GfbBwvb,"This is a great thing ...to see NEW and ORIGINAL black and African heroes and modern legends being written. It's better to be original, than to be stilted and just a ""black version"" 👍🤘"

2951,CuX3GfbBwvb,In Africa there are also white people...
2952,CuX3GfbBwvb,"1,2, & 5 were great stories.  3, 6 & 10 emotional stories."

 Mevcudiyetinin ve istikbalinin yegâne temeli budur. Bu temel, senin en kıymetli hazinendir. İstikbalde dahi seni bu hazineden mahrum etmek isteyecek dâhilî ve haricî bedhahların olacaktır. Bir gün, istiklal ve cumhuriyeti müdafaa mecburiyetine düşersen, vazifeye atılmak için içinde bulunacağın vaziyetin imkân ve şeraitini düşünmeyeceksin. Bu imkân ve şerait, çok namüsait bir mahiyette tezahür edebilir. İstiklal ve cumhuriyetine kastedecek düşmanlar, bütün dünyada emsali görülmemiş bir galibiyetin mümessili olabilirler. Cebren ve hile ile aziz vatanın bütün kaleleri zapt edilmiş, bütün tersanelerine girilmiş, bütün orduları dağıtılmış ve memleketin her köşesi bilfiil işgal edilmiş olabilir. Bütün bu şeraitten daha elim ve daha vahim olmak üzere, memleketin dâhilinde iktidara sahip olanlar, gaflet ve dalalet ve hatta hıyanet içinde bulunabilirler. Hatta bu iktidar sahipleri, şahsi menfaatlerini müstevlilerin siyasi emelleriyle tevhit edebilirler. Millet, fakruzaruret içinde harap ve bitap düşmüş olabilir.
 Ey Türk istikbalinin evladı! İşte, bu ahval ve şerait içinde dahi vazifen, Türk istiklal ve cumhuriyetini kurtarmaktır. Muhtaç olduğun kudret, damarlarındaki asil kanda mevcuttur.
 Mustafa Kemal Atatürk"

3336,Ct4JrS0PylN,Fury >>> entire dceu characters 🐐
3337,Ct4JrS0PylN,The AI intro really used to judge the whole eps 1 💀 these ppl always complaining bro
3338,Ct4JrS0PylN,The first episode was so boring considering the amazing cast
3339,Ct4JrS0PylN,Only Fury. NO Hill
3340,Ct4JrS0PylN,Boring show...😂
3341,Ct4JrS0PylN,"I barely able to finish the episode, it was so boring and uninteresting"
3342,Ct4JrS0PylN,More like “No artists. Only AI.”
3343,Ct4JrS0PylN,I want to play Spider-Man: Miles Morales in live action (a movie)
3344,Ct4JrS0PylN,Brilliant! Loved the first episode… pretty ballsy folks!! 🙌😁

3353,Ct4JrS0PylN,Super awesome!! Not holding back with the bullshit woke stuff
3354,Ct4JrS0PylN,Boring show so far
3355,Ct4JrS0PylN,Tinker Tailor Soldier Skrull
3356,Ct4JrS0PylN,Did AI write this episode also?  Lowest energy Marvel outing ever.
3357,Ct4JrS0PylN,SAY NO TO AI
3358,Ct4JrS0PylN,so you'll hire artists to make this art...but you use trashy AI for your intro...hm
3359,Ct4JrS0PylN,🔥🔥
3360,Ct4JrS0PylN,❤️
3361,Ct4JrS0PylN,"Let’s be honest, the dystopian and inhuman AI intro fits the vibe of the show perfectly."

3363,Ct4JrS0PylN,AI did this?

3617,Cth3QgLvyuP,SHOULD OF STOPPED AT INDY 3
3618,Cth3QgLvyuP,Huge miss not casting ke in the latest installment
3619,Cth3QgLvyuP,My takeaway is y’all try too hard to be inclusive by writing in a woman who’s the daughter of some side character when Short Round has been there the whole time probably following in Indy’s footsteps but do we get that story? The one that connects back to our experiences of early indy? Nope. Total fumble
3620,Cth3QgLvyuP,So when are these two doing a live action version of UP?
3621,Cth3QgLvyuP,How can you not love them!!!
3622,Cth3QgLvyuP,❤️
3623,Cth3QgLvyuP,Who the hell is this guy - Brandon
3624,Cth3QgLvyuP,Whatever happen to Shorty??? How come he never returned in the 3rd or 4th movie?
3625,Cth3QgLvyuP,Two legends
3626,Cth3QgLvyuP,The real duo
3627,Cth3QgLvyuP,l Love Harrison Ford ❤️❤️

3883,Ctb7x7rPZjF,And that’s how we keep a copyright. Honestly I think it’s so dumb for certain copyrights to expire. Why should something someone else invented be of public use? You should always pay for rights to something you didn’t create.

As we all know, a straightforward person will never talk too much. @spiritual.oluwabola will never seize from my lips as far as there's life in my body. What he did for me was something no one will ever forget. I'm here to talk about how @spiritual.oluwabola  rescued me from a broken relationship. 1 was really hopeless and because of my relationship traumas but luckily for me all of a sudden, I saw a comment online to this great spiritualist and his services so, I decided to give a one-time-trial cos I was hopeless at that point. To my greatest surprise, i received my healing and cleansing altogether and my partner came back to me and we're both living a blissful life now. Y'all should contact this man in order to get your relationship problems solved."

4047,CtUh_hihrUD,She should play abby in tlou s2
4048,CtUh_hihrUD,Terrible acting
4049,CtUh_hihrUD,Detracts from both of those stories. Awful actress.
4050,CtUh_hihrUD,Terrible acting
4051,CtUh_hihrUD,"Ugh, it's like promoting dry paint 😂"
4052,CtUh_hihrUD,Isn’t she piper from agents or nah?
4053,CtUh_hihrUD,She is lesbian?
4054,CtUh_hihrUD,And this is how capitalism turns #CelebratePride into commercialism.
4055,CtUh_hihrUD,Wasn't she in black lighting?
4056,CtUh_hihrUD,Excited to see where her career goes from here. Would be cool to work with her one day.
4057,CtUh_hihrUD,Do not care about either of these characters
4058,CtUh_hihrUD,Celebrate wokeness.
4059,CtUh_hihrUD,He’s pretty meh
4060,CtUh_hihrUD,She is also in Agents of SHIELD
4061,CtUh_hihrUD,This is NOT officer K
4062,CtUh_hihrUD,AKA Michelle Rodriguez Jr.
4063,CtUh_hihrUD,Why are people being so hateful? Her episode in the Mandalorian was fine. It’s probably the only episode which actually mattered in the overall plot of the season.
4064,CtUh_hihrUD,she should def play abby in live action TLOU
4065,CtUh_hihrUD,The way she set up the scientist in mandalorian 😡
4066,CtUh_hihrUD,"Trolls don't disappoint, do they? 😂. She's amazing and a right badass."
4067,CtUh_hihrUD,Cool but What’s the #celebratePride hashtag for though?
4068,CtUh_hihrUD,She was so cool in mandalorian season 2 and 3
4069,CtUh_hihrUD,Stop hiring her?
4070,CtUh_hihrUD,Worst part of both 😂
4071,CtUh_hihrUD,ant man was cheeks
4072,CtUh_hihrUD,Disney and it’s global agenda keep losing customers every day by the thousands
4073,CtUh_hihrUD,The rookie!! That’s where I know her from!
4074,CtUh_hihrUD,"She did a great job in Mandolorian, wish she got more to do Quantamania"
4075,CtUh_hihrUD,She was also in Marvels Agents of Shield
4076,CtUh_hihrUD,She’s amazing
4077,CtUh_hihrUD,So always insufferable characters then
4078,CtUh_hihrUD,a struggle to watch in both franchises

4082,CtUh_hihrUD,"Strong lad, weak actor."

4084,CtUh_hihrUD,Disney sucks
4085,CtUh_hihrUD,Crappy characters in both. Probably says sobering about the actress🤔
4086,CtUh_hihrUD,She deserves better roles lol
4087,CtUh_hihrUD,Loved her in one and despised her in the other. That’s a tribute to the actor.
4088,CtUh_hihrUD,She did a phenomenal job! I can't wait to see her in everything she does next!
4089,CtUh_hihrUD,"No diss to the actress herself, but she was my least favorite character for both of these😅"
4090,CtUh_hihrUD,I love her. She commands the screen. I want to see more of her.
4091,CtUh_hihrUD,🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 Katy is the best 💖💖💖
4092,CtUh_hihrUD,Terrible in both
4093,CtUh_hihrUD,yall haters pretty delusional
4094,CtUh_hihrUD,When will Disney cast trans actors?!?! There are over 500 genders that haven’t been represented yet!!!
4095,CtUh_hihrUD,She’s a beast 👏👏👏👏 @thekatyo

Especially disappointed that it’s no longer possible to watch @disneymbs. I’m a 5th grade public school teacher and I teach the book. I have been showing the episodes to my class throughout the year. We were looking forward to watching the last two this week. I had to tell my students that it’s not possible for me to show them the episodes anymore.

We will never respect your project to destroy the concept of REAL FAMILY! 🏳️‍🌈❌ Asexuality is does not mean freedom. It is the duty and responsibility of sensible adults to prevent this. Otherwise, a psychopath young generation will emerge, take care of your children before it is too late and keep them away from this mentality, PLEASE! 🙏🏻"

4718,CstzOYnhhgL,removing dozens of titles is an excellent way of reassuring subscribers that your original content will have a home (and thus a reason to subscribe) and an excellent way of encouraging creatives to make content for you. /s if it isn’t obvious.

4737,CsrD1frhNKk,This looks so cool I can’t wait!!!
4738,CsrD1frhNKk,Reminds me of Black Panther 🖤🐆💜
4739,CsrD1frhNKk,"Bro, the entire comment section getting me more and more hype for this"
4740,CsrD1frhNKk,"Here comes the WOKE crowd, mad at any form of diversity lmao"
4741,CsrD1frhNKk,It dropped today and there’s been zero promo on the main page about it… smh
4742,CsrD1frhNKk,yo thats hype actually
4743,CsrD1frhNKk,Why is this buried??
4744,CsrD1frhNKk,The soundtrack is about to go crazy 🔥
4745,CsrD1frhNKk,And you guys better not remove this show in the near future just like you removed the others.
4746,CsrD1frhNKk,And withDisney+ been unavailable in majority of African Countries...our stories restricted to us but for the put for the outside world wow
4747,CsrD1frhNKk,Bout time we got more African content
4748,CsrD1frhNKk,i’m glad you’re making more diverse original content but the practice of erasing original shows and movies mere months after releasing kind of undercuts it a little…
4749,CsrD1frhNKk,Okay this actually looks lit! Finally something fresh 😍😍
4750,CsrD1frhNKk,“Original anthology of short films” got me hyped
4751,CsrD1frhNKk,I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard the word diversity
4752,CsrD1frhNKk,"Jews believe that the true religion is Islam, they believe that they can do anything, knowing that Islam will be theirs, they believe that they have such a right. They see themselves as sons of God. Because they believe in these, they believe that they will go where they want in the hereafter, even if the savior is not one of them. They believe that Allah created everything in the world for them. So mistakes do not prevent them, in our opinion, religion or mistakes do not concern them. They believe that everything that happens in and in Islam is for them within the framework of their own rules. so they can do anything for themselves."
4753,CsrD1frhNKk,"@disneyplus should do this for a lot of cultures. Hire local artists and give them the funding to promote their own legend, culture, and folklore to the forefront of Disney. Not a culmination like what they did with RAYA and the Last Dragon. Make it a series of stories, an anthology."
4754,CsrD1frhNKk,❤️❤️❤️
4755,CsrD1frhNKk,Amazing
4756,CsrD1frhNKk,😍😍

4824,CsopvNaPQNa,For how long? Lol
4825,CsopvNaPQNa,80% of Crystal Skull is a decent movie. It's just the other 20% almost spoils the entire thing.  1- Last Crusade 2- Raiders 3-ToD 4- KoTCS
4826,CsopvNaPQNa,Where are the young Indy pics
4827,CsopvNaPQNa,you watch temple of doom and then you watch raiders of the lost arc
4828,CsopvNaPQNa,The temple of doom & Raiders r #classics..lol😂can keep the other 2
4829,CsopvNaPQNa,They should've ended at no. 3
4830,CsopvNaPQNa,Young Indiana Jones?
4831,CsopvNaPQNa,Crystal Skull overhated
4832,CsopvNaPQNa,Yay!!
4833,CsopvNaPQNa,"Fun fact:😂 haven't watched any of these, like is it really interesting thinking I should start or not 😏"
4834,CsopvNaPQNa,Wasn't called Indiana Jones and the raiders of the lost ark. Originally called Raiders of the lost ark.
4835,CsopvNaPQNa,Last crusade is still the greatest movie followed by temple of doom
4836,CsopvNaPQNa,I really hate to admit this well not really but...... I like Kingdom of the crystal skull
4837,CsopvNaPQNa,It’s called RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK 🙂
4838,CsopvNaPQNa,Can’t wait
4839,CsopvNaPQNa,Temple of doom is so disturbing 🤣
4840,CsopvNaPQNa,"Temple of doom still remains my all-time favorite, one of them all"
4841,CsopvNaPQNa,❤️
4842,CsopvNaPQNa,😍😍😍

4846,CsopvNaPQNa,and Latam? :(
4847,CsopvNaPQNa,Cool
4848,CsopvNaPQNa,Can't wait to rewatch the TRILOGY
4849,CsopvNaPQNa,"Once again, KK and The Woke Disney Company has successfully sh*t epically on another beloved George Lucas franchise."
4850,CsopvNaPQNa,Woke Disney stock has tanked BELOW $90 per share. How low will Woke Disney go?  #GoWokeGoBroke
4851,CsopvNaPQNa,But will they actually show up in the UK? Or are they gonna show up over a month later like the Spider-Man movies? I'm not salty at all lol 😆

5014,CsePywSRWmq,The death of Leslie is the saddest part of Bridge to Terabithia
5015,CsePywSRWmq,OMG NEWSIES
5016,CsePywSRWmq,Kiera Knightly was in Star Wars??
5017,CsePywSRWmq,"In case y’all wondering of the actors: AnnaSophia Robb, Samuel L. Jackson, Keira Nightley, Christian Bale, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Sandra Bullock, Ethan Hawke, Keri Russell, Tom Hanks, Leslie Mann"
5018,CsePywSRWmq,Why wouldn’t you use Mace Windu?
5019,CsePywSRWmq,Tryin’ to look like Keira knightley 🧙‍♂️ 🧙‍♀️ 🪄 🌃
5020,CsePywSRWmq,"Ok, but it'd also #NationalBeeDay and y'all should go watch the (highly unscientific but wholesomely entertaining) Bee Movie on HBO Max. 🐝"
5021,CsePywSRWmq,Leslie ❤️
5022,CsePywSRWmq,real ones know her as Bethany Hamilton
5023,CsePywSRWmq,Sandra Bullock is allergic to aging omg
5024,CsePywSRWmq,That's natalie portman and keira knightley
5025,CsePywSRWmq,Lol doesn't Christian bale hate the newsies
5026,CsePywSRWmq,"If Jack Kelly wasn't every choir kid's first crush, then watch it again."
5027,CsePywSRWmq,Wow. Tom Hanks did not age all that well.
5028,CsePywSRWmq,The negotiator is a classic!
5029,CsePywSRWmq,"Whoa whoa whoa Disney, 10 things is great and all, but if y’all are going to do a comparison of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the Disney movie he should be pictured in is the movie he starred in and LEFT NO CRUMBS IN: Angels in the Outfield!"
5030,CsePywSRWmq,"I only loved Leslie Burke in Bridge to Terabitha, it makes me all very upset in the end it breaks my heart"
5031,CsePywSRWmq,Thanks for reminding me of Bridge to Terabithia 🥲🥲
5032,CsePywSRWmq,I saw Bridge to Terebithia in theaters as a kid and it was the first movie that ever made me cry!!! Once I realized what happened I cried the rest of the movie and alllll the way home. Such a great movie!!
5033,CsePywSRWmq,Bridge to terabithia isn't  on the UK Disney+ and it's not fair
5034,CsePywSRWmq,"I will always love #sandrabullock in everything but where I fell in love with her was ""While You Were Sleeping"" (and The Net)"
5035,CsePywSRWmq,Ohhh im gonna watch  bridge yo terabithia
5036,CsePywSRWmq,For National Streaming Day please keep the shows we want to stream instead of making them disappear without any chance to own on DVD. #willow #willowdisneyplus #willowseries #renewwillow #waitingforwillow #keepwillow #savewillow
5037,CsePywSRWmq,Tone deaf post in light of the likes of you ripping hard working writers off and not allowing them fair compensation.
5038,CsePywSRWmq,Both Batman and Robin are in here!
5039,CsePywSRWmq,"Listened to Bridge to Terabithia for the first time, thinking it was children's fantasy. The last 4 chapters were disrespectful lol.  Wasn't expecting the heart punches near the end."
5040,CsePywSRWmq,stop taking originals off the service without releasing them on physical media
5041,CsePywSRWmq,"what if, for national streaming day, you decide to keep your original content available for streaming instead of erasing the hard work of everyone involved in each project to “cut costs”?"
5042,CsePywSRWmq,Leslie. 😢😢
5043,CsePywSRWmq,#hsmtmts us please 😭
5044,CsePywSRWmq,Dude I was OBSESSED with Anna Sophia Robb as a kid-truly a childhood icon

5059,CsePywSRWmq,I love Ethan Hawke so much! 🥺
5060,CsePywSRWmq,@disneyplus @hulu Why delete willow from your platform after less than a year? you should advertise him more or at least let us see him even after 26 with some device or something.
5061,CsePywSRWmq,@disneyplus How about not “cutting costs” and keep what thousands of hard working people took hours and hours to make.  There’s a lot of content a lot of us haven’t seen not for lack of interest but lack of time.  Several things on my queue are going away.  Not cool. 😔😔😔
5062,CscbDfYvxd8,Ugh that shadowhunters tv show is the biggest disappointment in book adaptation history

5333,CsWalofRsFE,Tardan demasiado en poner una película en su canal 👎🏻
5334,CsWalofRsFE,This film did not have Ernesto telling a story. This was a film that would not bother to see it again.
5335,CsWalofRsFE,Hot take: this movie is overhated. Is it perfect? No. But I’d watch it again.

5347,CsUcnw3M6DV,"1.  I will never call it “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark”.

2.  We need the original, unedited episodes of “The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles”."
5348,CsUcnw3M6DV,Leave off Crystal Skull and give us Angels In The Outfield instead.
5349,CsUcnw3M6DV,"Good Trilogy, there is no 4th Movie"
5350,CsUcnw3M6DV,Cool.. but it's just Raiders of the Lost Ark. Ain't no Indy Jones in that title. All this revisionist history is so annoying.
5351,CsUcnw3M6DV,
5352,CsUcnw3M6DV,Nobody wants Crystal Skull
5353,CsUcnw3M6DV,Could we please have the TV show? Young Indiana Jones deserves to be remembered!
5354,CsUcnw3M6DV,"Please, also give us the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. That series was awesome!!!"
5355,CsUcnw3M6DV,We don’t talk about the 4th one tho

5364,CsUcnw3M6DV,I mean… can’t we just ignore Crystal Skull ever existed? Also please don’t be references as canon on the new film 🙏🏼😬
5365,CsUcnw3M6DV,please put the young Indiana Jones series on Disney+ too!!!
5366,CsUcnw3M6DV,You can keep the fourth one off of Disney+
5367,CsUcnw3M6DV,Can we just pretend Crystal skull didn’t happen?
5368,CsUcnw3M6DV,HECK YEAH
5369,CsUcnw3M6DV,🙌The trilogy is great only the 4th part doesn't belong there because it's a horrible movie 😂in my eyes 👀 and I'm really hyped for the 5th movie it look so good the scene with young indy i have a good feeling about it 👀👍

5519,CsJiWv4OZ1B,Quantumania wasnt awful but i wouldve preferred higher stakes and a more grounded version. This seemed too big for a solo antman film yet at the same time not enough for a kang film.

5569,CsFMbmivpCi,Weird Al 🐐
5570,CsFMbmivpCi,I watched the show earlier today and I absolutely loved it. The show is really really great you need to watch it.
5571,CsFMbmivpCi,"Disney announced during its earnings call today that a price increase will be coming to the Disney+ ad-free subscription tier. The company did not indicate how much the cost would increase, or if it would specifically impact the Disney+ Basic tier as well.

Bob Iger, the current CEO of The Walt Disney Company, reported they have “price elasticity for the service.” They are hoping to “widen the delta” between subscriptions for the ad-supported service and the ad-free service. They are also hoping to drive more subscriptions to the Disney+ Basic Tier, even though it is cheaper for customers.

On the topic, he said “The truth is we have only just begun to scratch the surface of what we can do with advertising on Disney+. And I’m incredibly bullish on our longer term advertising positioning. Meanwhile, the pricing changes we’ve already implemented have proven successful and we plan to set a higher price for our ad-free tier later this year to better reflect the value of our content offerings.”"

5738,Cr9F1TtPVtV,❤️❤️
5739,Cr9F1TtPVtV,Can we get season 3 rose wood? Almost all shows on disney plus suck vomit
5740,Cr9F1TtPVtV,🏁
5741,Cr8qYO-vBay,Nothing has touched “Ronin” yet.
5742,Cr8qYO-vBay,First season was better
5743,Cr8qYO-vBay,"Sith and Screecher's Reach are the best piece of content that came from Disney so far. Its just my opinion, but these episodes have immaculate storytelling that is challenging, philosophical, stylish, and uniquely Star Wars. Finally."
5744,Cr8qYO-vBay,Honestly VISIONS just makes me mad that there is not more of the shows………
5745,Cr8qYO-vBay,"The bandits of colak Was so beautiful, a bit like clonewars but different"
5746,Cr8qYO-vBay,"Journey to the dark head when so unbelievably hard, every episode was a banger"
5747,Cr8qYO-vBay,Season 1 was better
5748,Cr8qYO-vBay,"Disney will literally slave over and dedicate their lives to Star Wars but when it comes to making new, refreshing projects, they half-ass it."
5749,Cr8qYO-vBay,these don’t look better than the first one
5750,Cr8qYO-vBay,I still like season 1 more.
5751,Cr8qYO-vBay,Really thought this said shit
5752,Cr8qYO-vBay,Bandits and Pit 🔥🔥🔥
5753,Cr8qYO-vBay,Spy dancer 🔥
5754,Cr8qYO-vBay,"Can we get some more Mando content?? I feel like all this content is all Jedi culture oriented, WE NEED MORE STAR WARS CULTURED TO BE APPRECIATED WITH THEIR CONTENT DEVELOPMENT"
5755,Cr8qYO-vBay,"Journey to the Dark Head was amazing that episode was absolute 🔥 I like Sith, I am your Mother, and Bandits of Golak was well"
5756,Cr8qYO-vBay,Screecher’s reach is the best in my opinion
5757,Cr8qYO-vBay,Sith and Journey to the Dark Head are PEAK ANIMATION 🔥🔥🔥🔥
5758,Cr8qYO-vBay,The anime ones are the best ones 🔥
5759,Cr8qYO-vBay,Screecher’s Reach and Aau’s Song >>>>
5760,Cr8qYO-vBay,Journey to the dark head was fire
5761,Cr8qYO-vBay,"Loved it, my only gripe is that there is a single male protagonist compared to the other 8. I LOVED EVERY STORY! But this is the kind of shit that fuels the fire. Bring balance back to the force. I wholeheartedly support diversity, but there’s clearly an agenda here.  Bandits of Golak was my favorite though."
5762,Cr8qYO-vBay,🔥Gonna need you to submit “In the Stars” for an Emmy or Oscar 🔥🙌
5763,Cr8qYO-vBay,I loved sith😍
5764,Cr8qYO-vBay,The Sith poster is giving me Portal vibes
5765,Cr8qYO-vBay,❤️
5766,Cr8qYO-vBay,“Journey to the Dark Head” was the best out of all Vision season 2
5767,Cr8qYO-vBay,Spy Dancer is an absolute gem. I need to know more about it at this point in life😭
5768,Cr8qYO-vBay,💫
5769,Cr8qYO-vBay,Bandits of golak and spy dancer were probably the best stories in my opinion. I wanted to know more. 😍
5770,Cr8qYO-vBay,Still crying about Spy Dancer rn
5771,Cr8qYO-vBay,Wow those are some unique art styles😍
5772,Cr8qYO-vBay,Haven't watched it yet but the animation for In The Stars and The Bandits of Golak look so pretty???
5773,Cr8qYO-vBay,"All of them were 🔥🔥🔥
Aau’s Song 🎶 and TriggerFish especially ❤️❤️❤️
Journey to Dark Head felt very familiar ✅👍🏿"
5774,Cr8qYO-vBay,The pit is the best ep of the 2 seasons
5775,Cr8qYO-vBay,Definitely better than volume 1.  More artistic variety and diverse stories.
5776,Cr8qYO-vBay,I love Visions so much
5777,Cr8qYO-vBay,Sith and In The Stars!!! 😍
5778,Cr8qYO-vBay,You NEED to collab with Cartoon Saloon and Aardman more often. Those were my two favorites of the group.
5779,Cr8qYO-vBay,Haven’t seen them all but Sith was so beautiful
5780,Cr8qYO-vBay,"LOVES SEASON 2! So many answering the call to become Jedi since season 1, are we seeing them again in future seasons??"
5781,Cr8qYO-vBay,Spy dancer was my favorite
5782,Cr8qYO-vBay,I love the variety.... Season 1 was too anime inspired
5783,Cr8qYO-vBay,Journey to The Dark Head was 🔥🔥🔥
5784,Cr8qYO-vBay,I'm already excited for Volume 3
5785,Cr8qYO-vBay,Most of these were so good and made me tear up. Beautiful animation
5786,Cr8qYO-vBay,Aau was so cute
5787,Cr8qYO-vBay,They are such great epic lovely episodes in differents animated style! 'm 🤘🏽🤩
5788,Cr8qYO-vBay,“Journey to the Dark Head” was my fav. ✨
5789,Cr8qYO-vBay,Journey to the Dark Head by @studiomir_official was 🔥🔥🔥 make that movie/sequel @lucasfilm
5790,Cr8qYO-vBay,Loved all of them!! 🔥🔥
5791,Cr6u3oBPDkO,Great posters for a bad season
5792,Cr6u3oBPDkO,The finales were great 🙌🏼🔥 The Mandalorians reuniting at last on their home planet and then Din and Grogu finally going on their own missions - speaking of which please please bring back Omera from Chapter 4. Her and Din definitely had something that needs to be picked up on! And anyways her character is left a mystery given her shooting skills
5793,Cr6u3oBPDkO,Morondalorian
5794,Cr6u3oBPDkO,Always check the hands. AI can't understand hands.
5795,Cr6u3oBPDkO,You guys should have a mandalorian theme Nintendo switch that would be awesome! :)
5796,Cr6u3oBPDkO,❤️
5797,Cr6u3oBPDkO,"I know a lot of people didn’t like this season and I think it does need some more improvement, but honestly I really enjoyed it! Very curious what they have in stored for Season 4"
5798,Cr6u3oBPDkO,"Can’t wait for season 4 needed it like yesterday, needs to be more then 8 episodes tho"
5799,Cr6u3oBPDkO,"3 season is bad! Sadly is bad there is no justification for what Disney has done to all their movies and characters sacrificing men in name of diversity with bad female characters,poorly female development funny enough they have taken every women and presented them almost like “men” is funny people might not realize it but I can tell you the box office of Marvel,Pixar and Disney…They Know…They know they failed miserably"
5800,Cr6u3oBPDkO,😍
5801,Cr6u3oBPDkO,"Oh yeah, grogu’s chest plate. Almost forgot about it cause we never see it again"
5802,Cr6u3oBPDkO,The Bo Katan Show Ft. Din Djarin
5803,Cr6u3oBPDkO,Now THAT is a poster! 🔥🔥
5804,Cr6u3oBPDkO,Wished they killed off the armorer

5812,Cr6u3oBPDkO,"Join me in celebrating this wonderful testimony because, thanks to @spiritual_obi_ I never thought I'd be able to get my spouse back. When my husband left me and my children, I never imagined that, after everything I had done to him, I would be able to win him back. However, I am overjoyed, thanks to @spiritual_obi_ interference, I was able to win back my husband. You won't regret contacting @spiritual_obi_ if you need assistance winning your partner back."
5813,Cr6u3oBPDkO,I would personally fund this show @disney

5980,Cr3hWtRt1rR,"A 2021 investigation by the Los Angeles Times found that Flamin' Hot Cheetos were actually created by a team at the Frito-Lay headquarters in Plano, Texas, to compete with other spicy snacks in the Midwest. Using corroborating testimonies from former Frito-Lay employees, the company's own internal investigation conducted in 2018, and a timeline of events, the report ultimately concludes Montañez worked on different products in the Flamin' Hot line, but didn't truly create Flamin' Hot Cheetos as he has claimed"
5981,Cr3hWtRt1rR,So it’s not about flaming hot Cheetos
5982,Cr3hWtRt1rR,If there’s one movie I deserve to be at the premier of. It’s this.

6232,CrvyadXBkGq,Family guy x star wars >>>
6233,CrvyadXBkGq,I prefer Family Guy Star Wars
6234,CrvyadXBkGq,We need another family guy star wars with the prequels
6235,CrvyadXBkGq,"Please be longer than 10 minutes. The last Simpson cross over idea wasn't bad, but it was literally I believe 8 minutes long. I definitely invite star wars x Simpsons if it's a full episode, but otherwise the shorts are super unmemorable"
6236,CrvyadXBkGq,Can’t wait
6237,CrvyadXBkGq,All these shorts but no movies
6238,CrvyadXBkGq,'Not Quite One' 😂
6239,CrvyadXBkGq,"Y'all need to quit while you're ahead and work on stuff people actually give a shit about, like maybe Alita Battle Angel 2 or half the other fan favorited projects you ditched to focus on this kinda bullshit 😂"
6240,CrvyadXBkGq,Why would they do a Simpson’s Star Wars show for the 4th? I feel like Disney can be so disconnected from their fan base.
6241,CrvyadXBkGq,"Can yall like, stop fucking around and fix ACTUAL star wars..."
6242,CrvyadXBkGq,Can ya sell Simpsons to universal please? 😅 or do a trade for Marvel stuff?? Does anyone still watch this show? I remember it being on tv around when I was like 7. Didn’t like it then and still don’t care for it now. 😂
6243,CrvyadXBkGq,Woohoo let’s go
6244,CrvyadXBkGq,Disney has literally thousands of different franchises they could mix with Star Wars to mix it up a bit but no let’s just do Simpsons for the fifth time.
6245,CrvyadXBkGq,Disney ruining two franchises simultaneously

Lots of Din focus, especially with the Darksaber. 

Also Din being corned by Mando’s, Gideon’s tie, Boba Fett.

I’m positive this season would’ve turned out a lot better and was supposed to but plans changed somewhere down the lane. Especially considering Temuera Morrison already came out and said he was supposed to be in S3."
6453,Crq2jByB3cs,I want Gina Carano BACK!
6454,Crq2jByB3cs,Ya’ll gotta stop showing Djin with the darksaber. Not only did he never use it ya broke it 5 minutes after he gave it up
6455,Crq2jByB3cs,For the most craptastic season of mando ever that should have edited down to a under 90 minute special
6456,Crq2jByB3cs,It would have been cool if din actually used the dark saber

6499,CroRwlzv72h,"When Katee sackHoff showed up in season 2, and was made more prominent in season 3 I certainly had my doubts. All I remember her from is as Starbuck in the revamped Battlestar Galactica but she certainly proved me wrong. 👏"

6504,CroRwlzv72h,She sits there perpetually in case din shows up
6505,CroRwlzv72h,Heard this show was boring by multiple people I’m not I’m going to give it a chance. Disney has been giving us wack stuff.
6506,CroRwlzv72h,Sometimes the concept arts are so much cooler. Probably because its a drawing not filmed i don't know

6565,CrjqjeqrP4I,Is my Last post Fire or should I Delete it?  😮
6566,CrjqjeqrP4I,criminal to forget the mustafar battle
6567,CrjqjeqrP4I,Luke vs Vader esb is hands down the most iconic.
6568,CrjqjeqrP4I,None of these. The correct answer is Anakin V Obi-Wan from Ep. 3
6569,CrjqjeqrP4I,Anakin vs obi wan but the real one
6570,CrjqjeqrP4I,In my opinion: Ahsoka and Maul 😍
6571,CrjqjeqrP4I,There's a reason why they didn't put Mustafar up there
6572,CrjqjeqrP4I,"Empire or Fates, but where is Anakin vs Obi Wan?"
6573,CrjqjeqrP4I,"It has to be obi wan vs anakin on mustafar from revenge of the sith, right?"
6574,CrjqjeqrP4I,The battle between my sanity and Instagram bots
6575,CrjqjeqrP4I,Dual of Mustafar is unbeatable 🥵
6576,CrjqjeqrP4I,Yall really put Bo vs Gideon when that shit came out like 2 weeks ago. The only correct answer is Ani vs Obi from episode 3.
6577,CrjqjeqrP4I,You chose the wrong Kenobi vs Vader fight
6578,CrjqjeqrP4I,Anakin vs. Obi Wan on Mustafar
6579,CrjqjeqrP4I,From these ones I’d say Ahsoka against maul but in total I’d go with anakin against obi-wan in Star Wars 3
6580,CrjqjeqrP4I,The clone wars one being a centimeter off bothers me lol
6581,CrjqjeqrP4I,No sequels🥺 thank god
6582,CrjqjeqrP4I,You forgot the only correct answer. Anakin vs obi-wan on mustafar. Was fire🔥
6583,CrjqjeqrP4I,It's obviously Yoda vs R2 on Dagobah
6584,CrjqjeqrP4I,Luke and Vader
6585,CrjqjeqrP4I,Duel of fates
6586,CrjqjeqrP4I,Anything that isn’t the new stuff minus cw
6587,CrjqjeqrP4I,Ahsoka vs maul is underrated
6588,CrjqjeqrP4I,Duel of Fates
6589,CrjqjeqrP4I,JarJar vs the Droids
6590,CrjqjeqrP4I,The answer is Yes + any other duel in the prequels
6591,CrjqjeqrP4I,The one that isn’t listed anakin vs obi wan revenge of the sith
6592,CrjqjeqrP4I,DUEL OF THE FATES 🔥🔥🔥
6593,CrjqjeqrP4I,I believe you’ve missed the duel on mustafar
6594,CrjqjeqrP4I,"4 Me, Either Luke v Vader OR Qui-Gon v Maul(There The Ones I Remember The Most)"
6595,CrjqjeqrP4I,ahsoka vs vader
6596,CrjqjeqrP4I,"Anakin vs Obi Wan Ep3, Rey vs Kylo Ep7, Rey & Kylo vs Praetorian Guards"
6597,CrjqjeqrP4I,"First one is most iconic, the best visual one is the kenobi final"
6598,CrjqjeqrP4I,There’s something about duel of fates
6599,CrjqjeqrP4I,Really tried to sneak in Bo and Gideon huh
6600,CrjqjeqrP4I,Qui Gon & obi wan vs darth maul is still the best
6601,CrjqjeqrP4I,"Anakin vs Obi Wan, episode III"
6602,CrjqjeqrP4I,Luke vs Vader Empire Strikes Back ❤️
6603,CrjqjeqrP4I,These are amazing but where is Obi-Wan Kenobi vs Darth Vader on Mustafar?? Their duel is without a doubt the best.
6604,CrjqjeqrP4I,"Most iconic is probably Anakin vs Obi Wan, but the Maul ones hit different. I mean Qui Gon, Ahsoka, the Inquisitors, all so fantastic!"
6605,CrjqjeqrP4I,"Funny thing is , the most iconic duel and it ain't here , episode 3 revenge of the sith , anakin vs obi wan"
6606,CrjqjeqrP4I,"Anakin vs Obi Wan, Episode 3"
6607,CrjqjeqrP4I,Obi Wan vs. Anakin on Mustafar will always reign supreme
6608,CrjqjeqrP4I,"Luke vs Vader is most iconic, but my favorite is ahsoka vs maul"
6609,CrjqjeqrP4I,Luke and Vader. Original ❤️
6610,CrjqjeqrP4I,"Empire Strikes Back, Vader vs. Luke is the best and most iconic."
6611,CrjqjeqrP4I,Episode 1 DUEL OF FATES is still the best!!!
6612,CrjqjeqrP4I,"Luke Vs Vader, then Bo-Katan Vs Moff Gideon, then Ahsoka Vs Vader!"
6613,CrjqjeqrP4I,Duel of the Fates @dave_maljanian
6614,CrjqjeqrP4I,"Anakin, obi wan on Mustafar, @disneyplus did you guys even watch star wars??😂"

6616,CrjO_yePJi4,When the storytelling mattered.
6617,CrjO_yePJi4,And there hasn't been a good film after this one and endgame. Hoping GOTG3 brings it back #Phase4WasADissaster
6618,CrjO_yePJi4,Marvel died with Iron Man
6619,CrjO_yePJi4,"Back when the MCU was great and not the trash it is..smh😩.. wish I could relive phase 1 and 2 all over again & 3 was awesome too, MCU will never be what it wants was😔"

6624,CrjO_yePJi4,"Definitely one of the best MCU movies ever (it’s number 2 on my list, number 1 goes to the 2012 Avengers)."
6625,CrjO_yePJi4,"Endgame had the best final act but THIS is the MCUs greatest achievement to date. My favourite film, it will be difficult to top! Unlike most moaning commenters though, I fully believe Marvel will return to this level of quality one day soon."

6628,CrjO_yePJi4,5 years of the Blip has finally passed. But we still have 6 months before the half return and Tony Stark dies.

Until I turned to a man that took away my pains in just a matter of weeks. @__grandpa_yentude96 was my backbone all through.

6730,CriznQMLwZr,Majors last movie
6731,CriznQMLwZr,"Man, I adore Marvel with all my soul, but for me this is the worst movie since Iron Man 3. Makes Love and Thunder look like Godfather. And the fact that the first two were so enjoyable makes this even more painful. The visuals are from 15 years ago, the plot is lazy, the acting is uninspired and Cassie is by far the worst character I remember watching. Kang does save his scenes but it’s definitely not enough. Quantumania feels like a stain in Marvel recent days and I hope to never see it again in my life."
6732,CriznQMLwZr,This movie was such a let down. I expected a lot more
6733,CriznQMLwZr,"This movie wasn’t as bad as people make it to be, it’s not the best film but still enjoyable. The only issues I had was the pacing of the first half, how MODOK was treated (a little bit), and Cassie’s performance could have been better. But overall iI found it still pretty enjoyable."
6734,CriznQMLwZr,Just update MODOK’s VFX
6735,CriznQMLwZr,Finally cause I didn’t go see it lol

Too many well-loved characters inexplicably missing, and the suspension of disbelief was too much for me at times. Still, way  better than the mess that was Thor: Love & Thunder, and more enjoyable than Wakanda Forever."

6766,Crg9W1Hh-gm,Il existe plus rien sur mandalor ? Les crystos de coirtion servent à rien? bokatan tu veux crée quoi avec c'est cristos des armures comme tes anciens ? Telle est la voie .
6767,Crg9W1Hh-gm,"How old is she? I mean, Obi-Wan got old but she looks the same."

6781,Crg9W1Hh-gm,Don't let this distract you from the fact they messed up the first time.
6782,Crg9W1Hh-gm,Hopefully she and Mando will be couple👨‍👩‍👦
6783,Crg9W1Hh-gm,"Mandalorian Bo katan - poses a discontinuity, a major contradiction--- Why? Because, in the Clone Wars & Rebels - she was there when her sister was / wasn't alive - Obi wan was there, & he was fairly young & along with Anakin. We don't see the events when Maul was vanquished in Mandalore and Bo took charge of Mandalore.  Now here she is - at the time where, Luke is quite young and Obi Wan is supposedly force ghost, Anakin is presumably dead even as Vader, Ashoka is very grown up - all seems to be in short span.  Either Bo is sort of immortal or ages very slowly."
6784,Crg9W1Hh-gm,They think they slick

6843,CrgOwvEBK4M,Anakin: oh damm I missed some
6844,CrgOwvEBK4M,I wish the episodes were longer than 3....4 minutes is not enough
6845,CrfE3bOr4Zo,definitely the worst season of the 3 so far. Episodes 7 and 8 made up for a little bit. Hoping if there is going to be a season 4 and it is with The Mandalorian and Din Grogu getting into and escaping some wonderful adventures.
6846,CrfE3bOr4Zo,🗑️season
6847,CrfE3bOr4Zo,❤️
6848,CrfE3bOr4Zo,"This season was not very good, very disappointing"

6850,CrfE3bOr4Zo,Lizzo ruined it
6851,CrfE3bOr4Zo,Great season. Grogu is BAE.
6852,CrfE3bOr4Zo,Love all the new starwars and marvel shows really loving the direction.  Thor love and thunder not as good as I hoped but at least it's not dc movies which are alot unwatchable. marvel Disney looking great
6853,CrfE3bOr4Zo,When are those glow pop things going to show up at Galaxy'e Edge....?

6856,CrfE3bOr4Zo,"@disneyplus You do realize the ratings for Season 3 wouldn't have been this bad if you hadn't fired Gina Carano, right?"
6857,CrfE3bOr4Zo,I'm so far behind that it's sad.

6865,CrfE3bOr4Zo,I will pls See More from the Villans in valley view
6866,CrfE3bOr4Zo,"Dear Disney! You probably, no let me rephrase, most certainly have the worst user interface across all OTT platforms. Firstly it takes ages to load. Then after an entire  ice age has passed one gets the error “sorry something went wrong. Please try again later”. I honestly thought it was my impatience that was not letting me deal with you. But the feeling and feedback is consistent across a cross section of users I have interviewed. So yes, congratulations. As if the interface technical issues was not enough it is also the most NON Intuitive I have ever seen. Why can’t a user at least see some basic info of a movie or a series or anything on your platform so that one can decide if one wants to watch or not. No. You make it mandatory for us to click. Go into the media. Then decide and come back if not Upto once taste. Absolutely rubbish design. Multiple clicks for NOTHING. Hope you take this as a feedback even though the tone might seem a rant of a disgruntled user. Cheers"
6867,CrfE3bOr4Zo,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
6868,CrfE3bOr4Zo,Din jarin figurín con the last episode is EPIC!!
6869,CrfE3bOr4Zo,I still haven’t gotten over lizzo that was just ridiculous

6871,CrfE3bOr4Zo,Noooooo
6872,CrfE3bOr4Zo,Sorry but this season is just the worst Star Wars I’ve seen since book of boba Fett

6890,CrbZxaxPYAF,They are milking this like 😂 please stop Disney

6905,CrbHNWgr9cD,he barely got to enjoy retirement 😭 poor Len
6906,CrbHNWgr9cD,"Len was a very special man and he is embedded into our hearts for so many reasons: His wit, his charm, his humor and kindness, his graceful presence and his love for the artistry and sport of Ballroom and Latin dance. He and I  would hold hands and tell each other “I love you,” before every show and then say “Now have a great show!” And we’d make some sort of sound to express our excitement. It’s been a tradition from day one. Originally we did it so we could express our different opinions without taking anything personally, but eventually, it was just what we did because of the friendship that had grown… I will hold these memories and the moments shared in my heart with gratitude and a deep reverence.  I join you all today in the spirit of love for our dear friend Len. ❤️"
6907,CrbHNWgr9cD,R.I.P Len. You played such a huge part in so many peoples lives ❤️
6908,CrbHNWgr9cD,he’s now officially dancing with the stars 🕊️🤍
6909,CrbHNWgr9cD,"I’m deeply saddened to hear about Len’s passing. A true legend and someone who was special to my life. I grew up watching him for years, and getting to know him on the show were some of the best memories for me. It was a true honor to know him. I will miss him deeply"
6910,CrbHNWgr9cD,Waltzing into heaven.
6911,CrbHNWgr9cD,"Len Goodman: Someone who made us laugh with his unintentional jokes. Someone who made us happy when our favorite couples got a ""10 from Len."" Someone who made us upset with his negative comments. And now someone who is making us cry with the news of his passing. I'm nineteen years old, and I've only been watching DWTS since S25, and I know that's nothing compared to the people who have been here since the beginning, but throughout these six years I've grown to really love Len. Though he was frustrating sometimes, the love everyone had for him was much stronger. When Len announced his retirement, I cried... a lot. I remember comparing it to ""feeling like my grandpa died,"" and I'm sure all of us are feeling like that right about now. Len was an angel in disguise, and we're all going to miss him very much. May he rest in peace 🙏 We love you, Len ❤️🕺"
6912,CrbHNWgr9cD,😩🫶🏻💔

6987,CrZJpNXPyYE,"Only 1/4 are worth watching, because you can justify that the story COULD have happened. The rest are outlandish studio fan flics. I mean Luke flying through space cutting up Star destroyers with a lightsaber? Come on."
6988,CrZJpNXPyYE,I'm envisioning the perfect day when Kathleen Kennedy gets fired.  #SaveStarWars
6989,CrZJpNXPyYE,The twins were my favorite episode it felt very star wars to me
6990,CrZJpNXPyYE,"Visions is so shit, please stop making it"
6991,CrZJpNXPyYE,Village Bride was so peak
6992,CrZJpNXPyYE,Fun fact the duel was made by the people that make the cgi jojo openings
6993,CrZJpNXPyYE,Pls add  attack on titan
6994,CrZJpNXPyYE,Episode 2 was truly awful. Almost abandoned the series after going through it
6995,CrZJpNXPyYE,des anime vrm disney ??????
6996,CrZJpNXPyYE,❤️
6997,CrZJpNXPyYE,"Idk if it was just me, but I was so excited to see Star Wars as Ana anime, and vol 1 was just bad. Hopefully vol 2 can be better because there’s so much potential"
6998,CrZJpNXPyYE,"Ep 1,5,and 7 all need their own stand alone shows"
6999,CrZJpNXPyYE,only like 3 of them were good
7000,CrZJpNXPyYE,❤️
7001,CrZJpNXPyYE,"My most favorite are The Twins, The Village Bride, Tatooine Rhapsody, Lop & Ochō and T0-B1."

7007,CrZJpNXPyYE,"I loved the ninth jedi the most, Kimiko Glen is such a great voice actress and the animation reminded me so much of Naruto"
7008,CrZJpNXPyYE,Why did they have to make it into a cartoon?
7009,CrZJpNXPyYE,The studios that worked on these anime made some of the best anime out there😭😭 everyone that says Any episode of visions is bad is lyin.
7010,CrZJpNXPyYE,9th jedi needs to be a movie
7011,CrZJpNXPyYE,More like binging 3 of them

7014,CrZJpNXPyYE,When did they make a Star Wars anime
7015,CrZJpNXPyYE,ANYONE NEEDS A BUSINESS/BRAND LOGO OR A CARTOON VERSION?
7016,CrZJpNXPyYE,Can’t wait for season 2!
7017,CrZJpNXPyYE,Hear me out...what if @disneyplus included all the episodes of  @dragonballsuper 💥
7018,CrZJpNXPyYE,The Twins and the Ninth Jedi need movies
7019,CrZJpNXPyYE,It's my opinion on the 1st volume came out. But i think I'll try with vol 2.
7020,CrZJpNXPyYE,Hi

7023,CrZJpNXPyYE,the elder was amazinf
7024,CrZJpNXPyYE,"OK, cool, add the older Doctor Who series, considering we will get the new one in November. Why make us wait for already released seasons?"
7025,CrZJpNXPyYE,I only watch the first one because of the animation style
7026,CrZJpNXPyYE,RELEASE AVATAR... WHATS TAKING SO LONG... 😡

7197,CrRte2EPfSi,Can we get more original content instead of live action remakes?
7198,CrRte2EPfSi,Do they really think ANOTHER remake of a Peter Pan is going to do well? 🙄
7199,CrRte2EPfSi,When will Disney stop remaking movies? And in the worst way every time?
7200,CrRte2EPfSi,Wtf is this????????
7201,CrRte2EPfSi,when are you gonna drop the antman quantumania in disney plus?
7202,CrRte2EPfSi,"In the latest edition of ""Why is Disney Hemorrhaging Money?"", I present another live action remake that absolutely nobody asked for..."
7203,CrRte2EPfSi,That’s a no for me
7204,CrRte2EPfSi,"As is never, ever going to watch it? Yup gotcha."
7205,CrRte2EPfSi,What even is this casting 😂
7206,CrRte2EPfSi,Stop remaking Peter Pan. It manages to get worse everytime
7207,CrRte2EPfSi,Nope I'm on strike to reboots.
7208,CrRte2EPfSi,Why American movies premiere is always in London not LA??
7209,CrRte2EPfSi,This should be in theaters.
7210,CrRte2EPfSi,Outro desastre da Disney

7213,CrRte2EPfSi,Peter Pan🤓
7214,CrRte2EPfSi,👎🏼
7215,CrRte2EPfSi,Hard pass
7216,CrRte2EPfSi,my bsfs in the cast 🤭
7217,CrRte2EPfSi,Its amazing how nameless adults on this comment thread have their weird political opinions on a kids movie. Build a house or knit a sweater of something...or better yet get a life.
7218,CrRte2EPfSi,I really hope I enjoy this movie….
7219,CrRte2EPfSi,"Okay I’m interested in this movie at all BUT the fact that the kids involved are getting a bit of backlash doesn’t sit right with me. This movie is Alexander Molony’s acting debut, meaning his first ever film job is FREAKIN DISNEY! I cannot even fathom at 16 years old getting that call from Disney telling you you’re gonna be in a mainstream movie. I would be immediately overwhelmed. The child actors involved need to be supported and loved. Disney should get the flack because it was THEIR decision to make the movie in the first place. 

Some of y’all need to (ironically) GROW UP."
7220,CrRte2EPfSi,❤️
7221,CrRte2EPfSi,Hook will forever be the best live action remake!
7222,CrRte2EPfSi,It makes me so sad that this cast full of wonderful children gets so much hate... Please know that you all are appreciated and I'm looking forward to the movie 💚👏🏼
7223,CrRte2EPfSi,🧚✨can’t wait ! Super excited ✨🧚
7224,CrRte2EPfSi,Pass
7225,CrRte2EPfSi,Good lord.

7231,CrRte2EPfSi,Another flop. Another loss added to their $123 billion

7264,CrRlg9QhNf5,This seems like an episode where the doctor is still getting used to his regeneration- something about the shot of his reflection gives off that vibe

7447,CrOUHsOrfB_,I needa renew my subscription 😢
7448,CrOUHsOrfB_,They need to make more episodes
7449,CrOUHsOrfB_,"its not that hard to recast a character, and im refering to cara dune"
7450,CrOUHsOrfB_,Worst episode in the series
7451,CrOUHsOrfB_,"Was this season as good as season 1 and 2? Definitely not, but is it as trash as people are claiming it is? Far from it... this was honestly a good season, not great, not amazing, just good, and I for one am okay with that. But now that Din and Grogu are out there doing their own thing again, I'm expecting season 4 to focus on just those 2."
7452,CrOUHsOrfB_,Why did y'all do a 50 min episode just to show that woman working in the new Republic to snitch to Moff???
7453,CrOUHsOrfB_,Anyone interested in Star was Fan GC ??
7454,CrOUHsOrfB_,"There'll be a season 4 , it'll be the final season following a movie"
7455,CrOUHsOrfB_,"Final season,so soon 😢"
7456,CrOUHsOrfB_,That was honestly one of my favorite seasons of any Star Wars of all time… all I ask is that there is more  thanks!!!
7457,CrOUHsOrfB_,What a creative failure of a season
7458,CrOUHsOrfB_,Are we a joke to you guys?? 30 minute finale?? Yeahh amazing🚮🗑️🗑️🗑️
7459,CrOUHsOrfB_,"What a Trainwreck of a season.... Maybe had you let Dave and Jon do what they wanted to do and what they were evidently setting up to do, you wouldn't have left yet another divide in the fanbase. Luke skywalker should have kept the child and the mandalorian should have taken mandalore either with or without Bo katan. The first 2 seasons of the show were perfect, this season... It was just really mediocre. I honestly want to know what other star wars fans felt about this season."
7460,CrOUHsOrfB_,Brilliant last two episodes to season three. What a build up. The finale was another epic episode. Waiting for season 4.
7461,CrOUHsOrfB_,This season was trash 🗑️
7462,CrOUHsOrfB_,"Boy was the underwhelming, and felt rushed,"
7463,CrOUHsOrfB_,9.5/10
7464,CrOUHsOrfB_,Where is R5?? Is R5 okay???
7465,CrOUHsOrfB_,I love Din Grogu ❤️❤️❤️
7466,CrOUHsOrfB_,disneyfied show
7467,CrOUHsOrfB_,Finale was shit
7468,CrOUHsOrfB_,Using Moff Gideon as the main villain 3 seasons in a row kinda hinders the season. They should of brought in someone new
7469,CrOUHsOrfB_,Amazing episode
7470,CrOUHsOrfB_,Season 4🙌🙌🙌
7471,CrOUHsOrfB_,I wanna say thank you to Disney and all the crew for a new season of the Mandalorian 🔥👏👏
7472,CrOUHsOrfB_,Man what happened to the doctor guy we haven't seen him since that episode
7473,CrOUHsOrfB_,41 mins with credits SMH come on y'all
7474,CrOUHsOrfB_,"Dont let your speculation affect your expectation, and youll be ok. Otherwise? Its rough"
7475,CrOUHsOrfB_,YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!
7476,CrOUHsOrfB_,Great season 🫡
7477,CrOUHsOrfB_,This is the way❤️
7478,CrOUHsOrfB_,it was a decent finale
7479,CrOUHsOrfB_,Awsome overall  but expected more action
7480,CrOUHsOrfB_,Din Grogu 💚
7481,CrOUHsOrfB_,"Decent finale. Not as good as Season 1 and 2, but still good 👍"
7482,CrOUHsOrfB_,yall really waited till the very end for a hot poster huh
7483,CrOUHsOrfB_,WE NEED S4 ASAP 🔥
7484,CrOUHsOrfB_,"Great season. 🙌❤️ Star Wars fans just easily disappointed because everyone has something THEY want to see. Not your show to dictate. Enjoy it for what it is. I enjoyed it. Laughed, cried, and we got a satisfying ending to Mando and Grogu. I really hope we see more. I’ll miss them terribly."
7485,CrOUHsOrfB_,Welcome Good Student This is Way Din Grogu 😍😢
7486,CrOUHsOrfB_,👏👏👏👏😀😀🔥
7487,CrOUHsOrfB_,This season was so great!!! ❤️❤️❤️
7488,CrOUHsOrfB_,😍😍😍😍😍😍
7489,CrOUHsOrfB_,Proud of my bébé 💚
7490,CrOUHsOrfB_,"I really enjoyed the finale episode, the epic battle, wrapping up the Moff Gideon arc, the battle with the Praetorian Guards all was done perfectly, the final ending felt like a series finale, so happy and wholesome :) 🙌"
7491,CrOUHsOrfB_,Some really great highs and some really terrible lows. Fire Kathleen Kennedy and hand everything to Jon and Dave.
7492,CrOUHsOrfB_,👏🔥👏🔥👏👏
7493,CrOUHsOrfB_,"Sooo, that’s what a shart looks like.  And, umm, #lizzothehutt 🤮💩🔥👀"
7494,CrOUHsOrfB_,Why was the last episode so short. You guys suck so bad omg 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 make MORE EPISODES AND MAKE THEM LONGER!!!!!
7495,CrOUHsOrfB_,@bestahmed …🤘🏽

8258,Cq25RTULNai,Season 1 was a mix between great and awful
8259,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Boring series. It tried to be Clone Wars S8 and S9 but failed terribly. It gets interesting only when Rex or Crosshair appear.
8260,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Final season?? Why???
8261,Cq2pCkfLDJb,"Why a final season that's dumb, keep it going like they did for the clone wars and rebels there was tons of seasons"
8262,Cq2pCkfLDJb,I misread that 😂
8263,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Yeah until they make another damn cash grab show. Tf is the point of making shows if they are just gonna keep being mini series starting to get really ridiculous
8264,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Third and final?!?!?! *does breathing exercises* I’m not ready to find out what ends up happening 😰😰😰😰😰
8265,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Final?
8266,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Bad batch is the most boring starwars tv series yet
8267,Cq2pCkfLDJb,❤️
8268,Cq2pCkfLDJb,"I can't be the only one who read it as ""Star wars: Bad Bitch"". 😂😂😂"
8269,Cq2pCkfLDJb,I knew it was gonna be the final season when I watched the S2 finale cause of how the story went
8270,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Final 😭
8271,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Wait why only 3 season's
8272,Cq2pCkfLDJb,THE TRAILER ON THE STAR WARS CELEBRATION WAS AMAZING😍
8273,Cq2pCkfLDJb,"Was really hoping for 4 seasons, like Rebels...sigh. At least we get a third season"
8274,Cq2pCkfLDJb,So third season will be final season?
8275,Cq2pCkfLDJb,i read it as Star Wars The Bad B!tch hahahaha sorryyyy
8276,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Final 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
8277,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Ich bin ein Grüsse Disney Fan
8278,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Oh no plz 😢

8280,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Live action?
8281,Cq2pCkfLDJb,When you say final……..
8282,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Happy that it returns for a third❤️ but it's sad that it will be the final😢
8283,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Why I always read this In a wrong way😭
8284,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Makes you fall in love with the characters then ends the show…
8285,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Can't wait! It's gonna be epic! But why is it the final season?
8286,Cq2pCkfLDJb,Definitely read this differently 😂x
8287,Cq2pCkfLDJb,"Yes!! We love Bad Batch. I love Clone Wars and i love this show! It's awesome, one of the best Star Wars shows. 🤩 So excited for the final season. Will watch it again from the beginning before season 3 arrives."

8519,Cqu8G0vsdYe,Ashoka is easily my favorite character in the series. I'm hoping they'll explore the reprocussions and rewards that being Darth Vader's Padawan has brought for her.
8520,Cqu8G0vsdYe,The only show I’m looking forward to lol
8521,Cqu8G0vsdYe,Expectations are high on this especially from her appearance in the 2nd season of Mando

8559,Cqu7drKsW9X,What's with this just announced stuff? It's all been announced before.
8560,Cqu7drKsW9X,I thought these were already announced?
8561,Cqu7drKsW9X,i don’t understand why people dislike star wars i understand that the movies with rey in it make no sense and disney is kinda ruining the franchise but star wars is more than just jedi and sith fighting it’s a galaxy not everybody out there swinging sabers and fighting the empire
8562,Cqu7drKsW9X,Who are those kids💀
8563,Cqu7drKsW9X,We already knew this… you could say “reaffirmed” instead of “announced”
8564,Cqu7drKsW9X,"Again not just announced, announced at D23"
8565,Cqu7drKsW9X,okey but no one asked
8566,Cqu7drKsW9X,"Bad batch is the best show, showing the life of the clones"
8567,Cqu7drKsW9X,Another announcement that’ll probably end up getting cancelled.
8568,Cqu7drKsW9X,"Just announced at #StarWarsCelebration:
Shit you already knew"
8569,Cqu7drKsW9X,"If it’s not about Jedi, yoda, or a skywalker, I won’t want it."
8570,Cqu7drKsW9X,Putting Filoni and Favreau on the stage doesn't even give me hope any more. Not after what they did to Mando
8571,Cqu7drKsW9X,Dang there really is no pleasing anyone at this point.
8572,Cqu7drKsW9X,A new series rey trying to build jedi order i think it will be a shitshow again (didnt she left the way of force after the last movie)
8573,Cqu7drKsW9X,They should make it more clear that the announcements aren’t the shows themselves but the new actors joining and/or release dates finally being announced
8574,Cqu7drKsW9X,"Destroying Star Wars, one waisted episode, one ruined series, one pointless character, and a space pirate at a time."
8575,Cqu7drKsW9X,"I like Star Wars shows, but I don’t want a constant stream of Star Wars, I want to wait for something I really enjoy."
8576,Cqu7drKsW9X,Why announce projects when there's a 90% chance it will be canceled?
8577,Cqu7drKsW9X,"No Brasil, Esqueleto Cru!"
8578,Cqu7drKsW9X,Star Wars is being milked at this point
8579,Cqu7drKsW9X,Skeleton crew sucks
8580,Cqu7drKsW9X,"Dios, te ruego que ya dejen morir Star Wars con dignidad!!!"
8581,Cqu7drKsW9X,Amazing!
8582,Cqu7drKsW9X,Man y’all fell off
8583,Cqu7drKsW9X,Make a Nien Nunb show.
8584,Cqu7drKsW9X,Please just make it stop. You ruined the brand already. Just make it stop
8585,Cqu7drKsW9X,don't care is lando cancelled or not
8586,Cqu7drKsW9X,Maybe watch it before making judgments?  Just saying. 🙄
8587,Cqu7drKsW9X,❤️
8588,Cqu7drKsW9X,Is Lizzo going to star in it.
8589,Cqu7drKsW9X,🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
8590,Cqu7drKsW9X,Why is there a Ford Pickup truck in Star Wars?

8592,Cqu7drKsW9X,I'm confused on who the skeleton crew are
8593,Cqu7drKsW9X,Is this animated or live action?
8594,Cqu7drKsW9X,👏👏👏🙌❤️
8595,Cqu7drKsW9X,"The next project-
Star Wars: The Raping of a Franchise."
8596,Cqu7drKsW9X,❤️❤️
8597,Cqu7drKsW9X,Need Star Wars zombies
8598,Cqu7drKsW9X,Looks cool!!
8599,Cqu7drKsW9X,"Damn I missed it when Star Wars was badass and serious. The prequels and the old movies are my movies, plus the clone wars."
8600,Cqu7drKsW9X,Fix Mandalorian.  Its pathetic at this point
8601,Cqu7drKsW9X,🙌🔥
8602,Cqu7drKsW9X,Skeleton Crew sounds good - will help round out the remnant empire era 💯
8603,Cqu7drKsW9X,Gunna be great! What a lovely cast and crew! Treasured experience working on this show!! 🙌❤️🙌

8612,Cqu3GOrMDne,what is it tho
8613,Cqu3GOrMDne,I don’t even know why they’re talking about this. Bob Iger has said that was canceled.
8614,Cqu3GOrMDne,"More unnecessary series, yesssss🔥"
8615,Cqu3GOrMDne,Yeah problem is it’s going to be Disney style bad guys :(
8616,Cqu3GOrMDne,The original logo was better
8617,Cqu3GOrMDne,What's it about?
8618,Cqu3GOrMDne,Star wars sucks if it is you producing it just stop going for the money and actually make something good.
8619,Cqu3GOrMDne,Need a Vader series
8620,Cqu3GOrMDne,Over saturation of Star Wars and Marvel projects
8621,Cqu3GOrMDne,Add the original logo back
8622,Cqu3GOrMDne,Stop beating the dead horse

8628,Cqu3GOrMDne,It wasn’t just announced
8629,Cqu3GOrMDne,You mean just announced in 2019
8630,Cqu3GOrMDne,Disney trying to milk star wars and marvel as much as they can at this point. Money grabs
8631,Cqu3GOrMDne,Wasn’t the lady in charge linked to some shady business with her former boss?
8632,Cqu3GOrMDne,"""just announced"" 😂"
8633,Cqu3GOrMDne,Is this secretly a Darth Revan series?
8634,Cqu3GOrMDne,❤️

8645,Cqu3GOrMDne,Lol wasn’t this announced 4 years ago? Probably the only show left from that long list that has since been cancelled. Just take every announcement with a pinch of salt these days #ripstarwars
8646,Cqu3GOrMDne,“Just announced that we’re still doing this one.”
8647,Cqu3GOrMDne,This isn't news lol

8679,CqtE52hPZzX,This is not the way
8680,CqtE52hPZzX,New planet in star wars?
8681,CqtE52hPZzX,"I thought it couldn’t get worse than the Imperial Biscuit scenario, then Lizzo showed up, and it got infinitely worse."
8682,CqtE52hPZzX,They recasted Jabba?
8683,CqtE52hPZzX,These cameos felt so out of place and the episode suffered because of it
8684,CqtE52hPZzX,Is there a dislike button I can press?
8685,CqtE52hPZzX,"Drinking game! Take a shot if:
-Complains about Lizzo and Jack Black in
Star Wars
-A joke about Lizzo, take two if it isn't related to Jabba the Hutt
-Someone says that Star Wars is ruined or along those lines
-Uses ""L""
-Says the season or episode is the worst thing ever or along those lines
- Uses ""mid""
-Comparing it to Marvel
-Claiming someone should be fired
Take two shots if it's a complaint not featured."
8686,CqtE52hPZzX,Why is jobba the hut in the show
8687,CqtE52hPZzX,I was really excited until I found out she wasn’t cast to play the Millennium Falcon
8688,CqtE52hPZzX,Can we please keep lizzo away from anything pop culture? Thanks
8689,CqtE52hPZzX,Not what I was expecting but it was fun
8690,CqtE52hPZzX,This is not the way
8691,CqtE52hPZzX,Man that episode was really disappointing it feels like Mando gets more disconnected from the vibe of the first season more and more jack black is awesome and lizzo seems cool but I don't feel like this was the appropriate platform for that kinda thing
8692,CqtE52hPZzX,Awful casting with Lizzo.
8693,CqtE52hPZzX,İ’m ok with cameos and stuff but this episode literally belonged to she-hulk or sth. Worst epispde of the show 🤦🏻‍♂️
8694,CqtE52hPZzX,April Fools was 5 days ago
8695,CqtE52hPZzX,Ngl this episode felt like a weird ass fever dream
8696,CqtE52hPZzX,Good thing for widescreens
8697,CqtE52hPZzX,This is NOT the way
8698,CqtE52hPZzX,"Definitely the worst episode. These cameos made the whole star wars enterprise feel like a joke and were totally out of place within the show. Please, never again🤦🏻‍♀️"
8699,CqtE52hPZzX,Only bad part of this episode was these two
8700,CqtE52hPZzX,"The moment the scene started I said, “Oh, my God, is that Lizzo?!” This episode was fun!"
8701,CqtE52hPZzX,She was the missing planet
8702,CqtE52hPZzX,This was the lamest episode in the show. Didn’t even look like star wars
8703,CqtE52hPZzX,this is not the way
8704,CqtE52hPZzX,Worst episode ever! I had to delete the Disney app
8705,CqtE52hPZzX,Worst episode in the show
8706,CqtE52hPZzX,The worst episode I have ever seen
8707,CqtE52hPZzX,Worst episode yet.
8708,CqtE52hPZzX,Worst episode the show has ever had
8709,CqtE52hPZzX,Jabba the hut is alive?!
8710,CqtE52hPZzX,
8711,CqtE52hPZzX,
8712,CqtE52hPZzX,I honestly don’t know what I think about this episode. Is it good? Is it bad? I CANT decide. I honestly am so confused about the entire existence of this episode
8713,CqtE52hPZzX,Worst writing ever by far. Set up the actors for failure and gave Bryce Dallas a garbage script. Awful for episode 6 of 8
8714,CqtE52hPZzX,Lmao remember when this show was interesting
8715,CqtE52hPZzX,Y’all ruined the show
8716,CqtE52hPZzX,I’m sure this comment section will be full of rationale and respectful responses
8717,CqtE52hPZzX,"Yoooo, Bowser in Star Wars LMAO."
8718,CqtE52hPZzX,I want to boycott this show bc of Lizzo
8719,CqtE52hPZzX,Wow star wars is dead
8720,CqtE52hPZzX,Boooooooooooooo. That was the worst Star Wars episode of all time
8721,CqtE52hPZzX,I love Lizzo and Jack Black! But this episode just felt like the writers got together and said “We need to have some cameos to try to draw people in!” Didn’t feel like it helped the plot of the show and didn’t feel like Star Wars to me.
8722,CqtE52hPZzX,"This episode was almost unwatchable so awful at every turn. Besides all the woke liberal bs, why is a battle droid running away, and now droids have feelings etc give me a break"
8723,CqtE52hPZzX,How can anyone take this show seriously anymore.
8724,CqtE52hPZzX,I enjoyed this episode. It was fun.
8725,CqtE52hPZzX,Jabba the Hutt is back!
8726,CqtE52hPZzX,I didn’t know Jaba the hutt was In the mandalorian
8727,CqtE52hPZzX,Such a bad episode…
8728,CqtE52hPZzX,Hey Disney! Stop ruining Star Wars
8729,CqrOy-HvR1t,Aqui los que no tenemos DisneyPlus 😥
8730,CqrOy-HvR1t,What nonsense is this

8779,CqqiosGB_2l,I fr thought this was a poster for a local escape room
8780,CqqiosGB_2l,The “Journey to the Center of the Earth” is practically just another freeway after this many remakes.
8781,CqqiosGB_2l,Idk why they had to reboot that movie
8782,CqqiosGB_2l,"Why would they do this. They don’t even mention the author of the book whose title they’re using for their ‘original series’ (Jules Verne), but worse, they modernised it. Modernised, in that early 2000s My Babysitter’s a Vampire kind of way. Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against remakes or adaptations, but c’mon ─ you’re giving my best man Otto a mohawk and goatee? The professor would THROW you INTO the centre of the earth in an anaphylactic rage."
8783,CqqiosGB_2l,"come up with one original concept, impossible challenge"
8784,CqqiosGB_2l,Just please stop
8785,CqqiosGB_2l,Spy Kids Steampunk Edition
8786,CqqiosGB_2l,Give me the 1959 version any day of the week with James Mason and the special effects of that time. Makes you feel kinda nostalgic. 😍
8787,CqqiosGB_2l,Was your budget a crisp 100$?
8788,CqqiosGB_2l,If there’s no josh hutcherson there’s no journey 🙄
8789,CqqiosGB_2l,"Didn't know about this , and saw this poster . And honestly , not giving it even a try , it just looks bad"
8790,CqqiosGB_2l,No one wants this
8791,CqqiosGB_2l,So ... another one ruined
8792,CqqiosGB_2l,"Do people not understand that journey to the center of the earth was a book before Brendan Fraser was in a movie semi based on it, and there has been several adaptations of it?"
8793,CqqiosGB_2l,ANOTHER remake?
8794,CqqiosGB_2l,Unless it has Brendan Fraser I don’t want it
8795,CqqiosGB_2l,Zzzzzzzzzzzz
8796,CqqiosGB_2l,Uhh..???
8797,CqqiosGB_2l,And yet I heard Loki season 2 was postponed but we get this😒
8798,CqqiosGB_2l,Brendan Fraser > Disney Plus
8799,CqqiosGB_2l,"Let me guess, they’re gonna try to push their agenda to us?"
8800,CqqiosGB_2l,Another movie that uses dinosaurs that look like they’re from a 90’s kids book
8801,CqqiosGB_2l,No one can replace Bredan Fraser
8802,CqqiosGB_2l,Looks like a bad spy kids remake
8803,CqqiosGB_2l,How about a live version of the Atlantis the lost empire
8804,CqqiosGB_2l,Original series? Wait what the. What did I watch in 2008?
8805,CqqiosGB_2l,Another childhood movie ruined 😢😂
8806,CqqiosGB_2l,It’d be nice to see a company not be greedy as hell…
8807,CqqiosGB_2l,NOOO LEAVE IT ALONE
8808,CqqiosGB_2l,Stop with all the remakes
8809,CqqiosGB_2l,I’m gonna watch the one the Brendan Fraser
8810,CqqiosGB_2l,🫴🏻
8811,CqqiosGB_2l,Why Disney series and movie nowadays feels like low budget version..
8812,CqqiosGB_2l,ANOTHER ONE??
8813,CqqiosGB_2l,literally...WHY?!
8814,CqqiosGB_2l,I’m genuinely beginning to think disney has run out of ideas
8815,CqqiosGB_2l,"No one wants this , this looks like it has a 2 dollar budget"
8816,CqqiosGB_2l,Wtf is that?
8817,CqqiosGB_2l,So we just gonna take the Brendan Fraser out of it?!?!
8818,CqqiosGB_2l,Nice but I love Brendan Fraser journey to the center of the earth movie
8819,CqqiosGB_2l,Why am I just now hearing about this?
8820,CqqiosGB_2l,"Erm, im not one to criticize but this looks..interesting? 😭"
8821,CqqiosGB_2l,"A remake, again?"
8822,CqqiosGB_2l,How dare you stand where he stood
8823,CqqiosGB_2l,This won't beat the Brendan Fraser movie.
8824,CqqiosGB_2l,Ha “original” series
8825,CqqiosGB_2l,Nice way to keep ruining classic movies😂
8826,CqqiosGB_2l,Was there any advertisement for this at all 😂

8857,Cqnl452Jwvy,When they gonna add the other muppet movies that’s not in there
8858,Cqnl452Jwvy,👏👏👏
8859,Cqnl452Jwvy,Sound like a Disneyland ride
8860,Cqnl452Jwvy,They should just remake Daisy Jones and the Six. Never mention it. Just redo it exactly frame for frame with these characters.
8861,Cqnl452Jwvy,can yall release avatar 2 on disney+ please😭
8862,Cqnl452Jwvy,They need to bring back the muppets show that was on abc

8900,Cqnl452Jwvy,We need an outtake photo of Animal facing the wrong way.😂
8901,Cqnl452Jwvy,Damnnn this looks goodddd
8902,Cql-SU0vm1C,Saw Gerrera? More like ✨Overexposure✨
8903,Cql-SU0vm1C,Why palpatine is present and not vader ???
8904,Cql-SU0vm1C,Are the Commandos still clones? I thought all clones were taken out of work.
8905,Cql-SU0vm1C,Man Cid did them dirty. I was not surprised though when that scene happened.
8906,Cql-SU0vm1C,Cid and Saw are now dead to me
8907,Cql-SU0vm1C,Disneyplus in Tanzania 🇹🇿 please...we can't stream the shows in Tanzania
8908,Cql-SU0vm1C,Is that scorch from the Republic commando video game?!
8909,Cql-SU0vm1C,Got a lot of nerve having the most evil characters in star wars on this list. Like how can you compare the emperor to villains such as Cid
8910,Cql-SU0vm1C,Half these characters stink. A lot of missed opportunities with Scorch and bringing in Delta Squad. Or even mentioning the name Scorch in ANY of the episodes
8911,Cql-SU0vm1C,Cid ruined this show
8912,Cql-SU0vm1C,Infelizmente star wars já se tornou uma franquia morta 😢
8913,Cql-SU0vm1C,Can't believe we wasted time with Bennie when we could have had Delta squad vs the bad batch
8914,Cql-SU0vm1C,I didnt like Saw before but now I really don’t like him. Going to watch rouge one to watch him die again.
8915,Cql-SU0vm1C,I hate Saw and Cid (actually I hate Cid even more than ever before)
8916,Cql-SU0vm1C,Saw and Sid can both go pound sand
8917,Cql-SU0vm1C,Che Guevara? nah. Saw Gerrera
8918,Cql-SU0vm1C,I hope cid gets 💀
8919,Cql-SU0vm1C,Mayday has a second face lol
8920,Cql-SU0vm1C,I never had a disliking to Saw until I watched this season. He maybe the worst ever I actually hate him now because everything that was the end was all his fault
8921,Cql-SU0vm1C,Two seasons and Howzer still hasn’t gotten his own poster💔
8922,Cql-SU0vm1C,Mayday lookin like AI art
8923,Cql-SU0vm1C,Captain Rex show would be interesting 🤔
8924,Cql-SU0vm1C,Mayday 😭
8925,Cql-SU0vm1C,Saw killed tech pretty much.
8926,Cql-SU0vm1C,i’m gonna enjoy watching saw die
8927,Cql-SU0vm1C,Damn Cid. Hate her.
8928,Cql-SU0vm1C,OMG WHY DOES MAYDAY HAVE FOUR EYES
8929,Cql-SU0vm1C,Anyone else notice the extra eyes on Mayday👀
8930,Cql-SU0vm1C,My fave scene of Saw is that one in Rogue One where he… DIES!!! ❤️
8931,Cql-SU0vm1C,Saw and Cid have just been added to my top 5 least enjoyable characters list 😭
8932,Cql-SU0vm1C,Best star wars show on D+
8933,Cql-SU0vm1C,i officially hate saw and it’s all your fault
8934,Cql-SU0vm1C,Rex looks so cool
8935,Cql-SU0vm1C,✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
8936,Cql-SU0vm1C,Any chance of the basic plan for Disney plus on roku? They need to add it
8937,Cql-SU0vm1C,✨💚✅
8938,Cql-SU0vm1C,😍😍😍
8939,Cql-SU0vm1C,Overrated show
8940,Cql-SU0vm1C,😍😍😍
8941,Cql-SU0vm1C,Boris Karloff over in the second slide is probably the least interesting villain in Star Wars.
8942,Cql-SU0vm1C,Howzer needs a poster
8943,Cql-SU0vm1C,All my homies hate Saw and Cid
8944,Cql-SU0vm1C,Rex shud get a spin off
8945,Cql-SU0vm1C,Noooo Cid whyyyyyyyyyyy
8946,Cql-SU0vm1C,Is it going to be a season 3?
8947,Cql-SU0vm1C,"I don’t like you, you ruin everything"
8948,Cql-SU0vm1C,😡😡
8949,Cql-SU0vm1C,It’s the best Star Wars show next to Andor and Mando.
8950,Cql-SU0vm1C,yo there’s a little glitch on mayday…
8951,Cql-SU0vm1C,WILLOW season 2 ???????

9135,CqgdZ9Xvwit,„Plan 99“ 😢😔
9136,CqgdZ9Xvwit,❤️
9137,CqgdZ9Xvwit,Bad Batch Season 2 outshined Mando Season 3.
9138,CqgdZ9Xvwit,Plan 99 was too much 😢
9139,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"Indefinately, and he will remain there until the negotiation is complete, and then he can appeal it with the court at that time,"
9140,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"They say, they tried their hardest to NOT pay the employee(r)! 
They say, they're so sorry; they're so sorry, if there was anything they could do, more, between then and now, and after the move, they'll make it up to you!"
9141,CqgdZ9Xvwit,This show was visually beautiful. And a great story
9142,CqgdZ9Xvwit,I’m still amazed how Coruscant can be recreated for a TV show. VFX have come a long way
9143,CqgdZ9Xvwit,Spoiler alert: (don’t click reply if you haven’t seen the episode)
9144,CqgdZ9Xvwit,Disney acknowledging the bad batch looks better than most of their SW shows is wild😂
9145,CqgdZ9Xvwit,We better see pabu again with the WHOLE batch
9146,CqgdZ9Xvwit,Phenomenal season
9147,CqgdZ9Xvwit,When have we ever followed orders
9148,CqgdZ9Xvwit,This show is so good! We need to have a another great season with season 3
9149,CqgdZ9Xvwit,Is Season 3 coming out like around April or may?
9150,CqgdZ9Xvwit,“When have we ever followed orders?”
9151,CqgdZ9Xvwit,Unreal season! I can’t believe you killed Tec! Maybe he made it
9152,CqgdZ9Xvwit,this season had some of the best star wars music ever!
9153,CqgdZ9Xvwit,When is Season 3?
9154,CqgdZ9Xvwit,Best D+ show right now
9155,CqgdZ9Xvwit,Dang this show is pretty
9156,CqgdZ9Xvwit,i cant believe you’ve done this to me
9157,CqgdZ9Xvwit,Gosh the animation is phenomenal! 🔥🔥
9158,CqgdZ9Xvwit,The animation was absolutely gorgeous this season
9159,CqgdZ9Xvwit,🏜🏝🌃This season the animation is in a whole new level! Congratulations to @joelaron and the VFX team!!👌🏼🙌🏼👏🏼
9160,CqgdZ9Xvwit,❤️❤️❤️
9161,CqgdZ9Xvwit,My husband Left me for 6 months for a little mistake that I made but thanks to @baba_odianosen_spiritual who helped me to restore my broken relationship now my husband loves me far more than I can ever imagine. So I urge you all if you are going through similar situation don't hesitate to contact @baba_odianosen_spiritual
9162,CqgdZ9Xvwit,❤️❤️
9163,CqgdZ9Xvwit,Why bunch up all these assets into these post instead of an individual asset per clip? really takes away from the powerful imagery!
9164,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"Only $1 billion dollars, and as much time as needed, and it could be practiced and discussed through television shows or some kind of battle.net,"
9165,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"Isn't it true the only reason they employed themselves there, was so that they might be able to murder a millionaire, and his children, a little bit?"
9166,CqgdZ9Xvwit,Isn't it true that they are set to deploy from the location in question to his estate with the intent of invoking more havoc?
9167,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"On a line chart, from the birth, until 2023, doesn't it suggest that?"
9168,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"And how many, approximately? and how many are en-route?"
9169,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"Only 1 more? Isn't it true that you needed to be sure that my client, there, was in the pocket?"
9170,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"These are pictures of 1990-2023,"
9171,CqgdZ9Xvwit,what kind of a person cld even take a picture of something so ugly?
9172,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"Of the suspects,"
9173,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"Awarded the profits of RC Cola, eh?"
9174,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"Milton, apparently his paycheck didn't show up last week, and still hasn't arrived; he mumbles,"
9175,CqgdZ9Xvwit,He claims the stapler belongs to him!
9176,CqgdZ9Xvwit,and doesn't give a care!
9177,CqgdZ9Xvwit,😍😍😍
9178,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"Unless you don't want to go at all,"
9179,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"I thought you should take it to court in Malibu, it's not that I don't want to go,"
9180,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"And of a negotiation, my court, is a court marshall, and the rules, 
are similar to a monachry that exists in the United States, with the President in the office next to mine, and I'm also the judge, and can sentence a suspect or violator to prison,"
9181,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"And so, those rules aren't applying to me,"
9182,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"These kinds of situations, I always put in a lot of hard work, so a television show like The Earthling, is like, the boy in question could buy a soda, or a coffee,"
9183,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"The boy would go over to over there, to deliver a soda, to a victim being kept, and then go home,"
9184,CqgdZ9Xvwit,"He would make an estate that is worth 2.4 trillion 625 billion throughout the course of his life, so his family could be safe,"

9483,CqYPZ9VtSrm,😍
9484,CqYPZ9VtSrm,🙌🙌🙌
9485,CqVrX5Shi33,"I don't mind that the lost boys have girls in it, I just find it weird that they're still called the lost boys. Just call them the lost kids?"
9486,CqVrX5Shi33,"Wouldn't they be lost children, though?"
9487,CqVrX5Shi33,Where is Ruffio? RU FI OOOOO
9488,CqVrX5Shi33,Lost boys were only boys but OK? 😂
9489,CqVrX5Shi33,"Why is everyone throwing a fit over them being the lost boys?? In the original movie even Wendy was called a lost boy, nothing to do with gender just what the group called themselves"
9490,CqVrX5Shi33,Enter people upset by diversity… now.  #sorryforexisting
9491,CqVrX5Shi33,Idk why ppl are so mad I’m the only woman in a group of guys I play video games with and we call each other “the boys” which includes me.
9492,CqVrX5Shi33,Y’all need to fix tinker bell make her white not black 👏
9493,CqVrX5Shi33,They can’t be called the lost boys if theres girls in it. At least change the name 🤦🏻
9494,CqVrX5Shi33,"“BUT YOU ARE NOT ALL BOYS ” “SO?” Seriously??? Wendy is supposed to be the first girl in Neverland, but see what happened now. Is it not even make sense"
9495,CqVrX5Shi33,I get people are mad they aren’t all boys… but as a tomboy growing up who pretended to be a lost boy whenever playing make believe I am excited to see it.
9496,CqVrX5Shi33,Lost BOYS? 🧐🤨
9497,CqVrX5Shi33,Damn those twins become the main villians in Farcry 5 New Dawn. Crazy.
9498,CqVrX5Shi33,"Tbh I’m just tired of the constant live action re makes. They are never as good as the originals anyway. Which is the reason I tend to not watch them. All the money put into them, they could have used it to keep the stores open or this may sound crazy, create a new idea. They clearly still have original ideas because Encanto was great 👍🏻"
9499,CqVrX5Shi33,everyone complaining about diversity needs to get a hobby
9500,CqVrX5Shi33,More like the lost alphabet 😂
9501,CqVrX5Shi33,It’s more messed up they called the child with DS “slightly” but ok
9502,CqVrX5Shi33,"I mean, I would just call them “The Lost Children’s” since there are couple of girls, no offense"
9503,CqVrX5Shi33,More Disney 🗑️
9504,CqVrX5Shi33,Ayo why is his name “slightly”? Seems like it could be really offensive if it means what I think it means
9505,CqVrX5Shi33,"Pretty sure none of you trolls live in Neverland, so kindly grow up. Stories evolve over time and are adapted to be more relateable to a changing audience. No one is making you watch it. And I can assure you, Disney will do just fine without you in the audience."
9506,CqVrX5Shi33,They all look so uninterested lmao
9507,CqVrX5Shi33,I feel like lost “girls” undermines the point of lost boys in the first movie but ok
9508,CqVrX5Shi33,"Since Disney is going woke, let's call them the Lost Them...."
9509,CqVrX5Shi33,Diversity done wrong
9510,CqVrX5Shi33,"I get that they are having female representation, but considering the reason for there being no Lost Girls in the movie/book is because “girls are far too clever to fall out of their prams” actually makes Disneys inclusion choice a little sexist LOL"
9511,CqVrX5Shi33,Ruins the whole point of being called Lost Boys if there are girls. The whole reason is because they don’t have a mother figure and have never even seen a girl in their lives and that’s why Peter brings Wendy to Neverland.
9512,CqVrX5Shi33,"“well originally…” in the original story Peter Pan is a villain who kidnaps children from their beds, yet that’s not what happens in the movie, clearly stories change over time"
9513,CqVrX5Shi33,"""the lost ones"" would make more sense"
9514,CqVrX5Shi33,"We already have mermaids, fairy’s, Tiger Lily, Mary Darling and Wendy we don’t need to turn lost boys in to girls😒"
9515,CqVrX5Shi33,You should tell us the important things like when season 5 of miraculous will be finished being released
9516,CqVrX5Shi33,Please make the rebooting STOP!
9517,CqVrX5Shi33,Can't imagine being so upset about a kids movie. 🤣
9518,CqVrX5Shi33,"What if for diversity you wrote new characters/princesses/villians/heros, rather than disingenuously altering someone's race, disabilities, gender, etc. Create a new story to depict and represent those without representation... Without just shoving them into the story whenever you can. That's lazy."
9519,CqVrX5Shi33,No one wants lost girls
9520,CqVrX5Shi33,I’m sure this comment section will be accepting and respectful. Right?
9521,CqVrX5Shi33,“Lost one’s” makes sense
9522,CqVrX5Shi33,Help no
9523,CqVrX5Shi33,❤️
9524,CqVrX5Shi33,Ah yes. The lost boys… and 3girls
9525,CqVrX5Shi33,👏👏👏👏
9526,CqVrX5Shi33,We love seeing the inclusion ✨
9527,CqVrX5Shi33,Cesspool of complainers on Disney+’s page.  Don’t like seeing non-white & developmentally disabled people on screen - don’t watch TV.
9528,CqVrX5Shi33,"“But you’re not all boys” 
“So”
In the original story by JM Barrie Peter Pan says to Wendy that girls are way to smart to fall out of their prams which explains why there aren’t any “Lost girls”"
9529,CqVrX5Shi33,I am so excited for this!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
9530,CqVrX5Shi33,Jooooo me encanta!!!!! ❤️💖💙♥️❤️💙💖♥️💙❤️💖💙❤️💚♥️❤️💙💚❤️♥️💙💖💙❤️💚❤️💙💖
9531,CqVrX5Shi33,"“But you’re not all boys…” 🤨
“SO!?”😡"
9532,CqVrX5Shi33,Look at all the doofuses upset that there’s girls in the group or black kids. I hate the internet
9533,CqVrX5Shi33,"I mean diversity is great , but stop remaking movies just to fit the ideology . Lol it sucks! Come on Disney let’s get creative and make some fresh new scripts - put the diversity there . I’m tired of 5 different Peter pans"
9534,CqVrX5Shi33,@giovannaa.pradoo let's watch it
9535,CqVqvI9heT6,I’m just here for the comments of people mad that a fantasy character isn’t their preferred color.
9536,CqVqvI9heT6,"I’m not feeling tinkerbell, they should have gotten dove Cameron to play her"
9537,CqVqvI9heT6,"Why in gods name do you keep on making remakes, no one wants them, get creative for once and make original content"
9538,CqVqvI9heT6,"Why do they always make the main characters black and indian? Why Polish, Albanian, Turkish, Italian, Russian, French etc. not? ""We are not racist, look we made our cast  from blacks and Indians"" Isn't this racism to other countries, other ethnicities? (I am not racist. I love indians and blacks. Please don’t get me wrong)"
9539,CqVqvI9heT6,What happened to blonde white tinker bell
9540,CqVqvI9heT6,The white is the bad?
9541,CqVqvI9heT6,I forgot the British enslaved India between 1670 and 1810 so I guess it kind of makes sense that Peter Pan is Indian during this time line but I don’t know that’s just me what are you guys think?
9542,CqVqvI9heT6,So are we gonna redo princess and the frog and make her white??
9543,CqVqvI9heT6,really why didn't tinkerbell dove cameron
9544,CqVqvI9heT6,Tink is black now? 🙄
9545,CqVqvI9heT6,Ngl why do we need these stories being told to us over and over i want sum new and creative
9546,CqVqvI9heT6,"Might be good, might not, we'll see. But the perfect live-action Peter Pan movie already exists. It's called Hook."
9547,CqVqvI9heT6,"Now everyone is upset with the casting for tinkerbell and Peter? Let me tell you this, I read the original book and Peter Pan never had an actual physical description, and nor does tinkerbell. They can be any race, etc., Please stop being like this."
9548,CqVqvI9heT6,hasnt this movie been remade 100 times already
9549,CqVqvI9heT6,Tiana in the princess in the frog better be white then
9550,CqVqvI9heT6,This cast is not what I hoped
9551,CqVqvI9heT6,"Don’t worry guys. The villain is still white, thats all that matters haha"
9552,CqVqvI9heT6,Why can’t they do live remakes of Atlantis or Treasure Planet instead?
9553,CqVqvI9heT6,"Is this the one where ""the lost boys"" don't identify as boys anymore?"
9554,CqVqvI9heT6,"I usually don’t have an issue with these controversial castings but it’s starting to feel forced… you have so many other movie options for representation and inclusion and yet you continue to choose to change old characters, why not new ones?? Or a live remake of Atlantis, Lilo & Stitch, Brave, Hercules, Moana, Ratatouille??"
9555,CqVqvI9heT6,Mr. Smee is the only one who looks like their original character 😂
9556,CqVqvI9heT6,This movie looks so terrible. No one is ever gonna watch this I won’t
9557,CqVqvI9heT6,The most unneeded movie😭 I wish they would make a live action tinker bell or something like damn enough of the same remakes
9558,CqVqvI9heT6,"The kind of blackwashing everything in a disney movie goes in the wrong direction. I'm also for the equality between man and woman but the lost boys were boys. It's an old classic Disney movie, you don't need to make everything completely accurate. Just do it like in the original"
9559,CqVqvI9heT6,peter not being a redhead and disney (as well as other companies) trying to find ways to squeeze in poc into their movies is so cheap and such a money grab
9560,CqVqvI9heT6,First Ariel now tinker bell 😭😭😭
9561,CqVqvI9heT6,hi disney! thanks for ruining peter pan 😢
9562,CqVqvI9heT6,This is wrong! Peter pan and Tinkerbell are not brown and black
9563,CqVqvI9heT6,Pedro pan
9564,CqVqvI9heT6,Why peter is not redhead? 😢
9565,CqVqvI9heT6,"Disney, se les entiende que quieran hacer inclusión pero esto ya está muy forzado, primero Ariel, ahora campanita? Después que? sigue Rapunzel?, cuál es la necesidad de hacer eso? Si quieren hacer inclusión pues hagan un personaje nuevo que sea prima o hermana del personaje principal 🤷🏼‍♀️"
9566,CqVqvI9heT6,They look like they were cut out straight from an SNL sketch …
9567,CqVqvI9heT6,Mais um clássico destruído por ideologia política.
9568,CqVqvI9heT6,Peter Pan has been redone so many times I think it’s time to give it a break .-.
9569,CqVqvI9heT6,Running out of ideas
9570,CqVqvI9heT6,BRB crying over my girl @yarashahidi spreading pixie dust and RADIANCE on the tl 😭✨
9571,CqVqvI9heT6,Thats not peter pan that's Pedro Panadero
9572,CqVqvI9heT6,NO Poor TinkerBell 🥺🥺
9573,CqVqvI9heT6,✨👏🏽😍
9574,CqVqvI9heT6,No
9575,CqVqvI9heT6,The original will always be the best
9576,CqVqvI9heT6,Making white characters black It is racism in itself
9577,CqVqvI9heT6,All I'm saying is it makes no sense that a fairy is black. Given their habitat. Hence why they are normally very pale
9578,CqVqvI9heT6,"Stop ruining our beloved classics with your wrong social justice narrative, there's no girls in the lost boys, Peter Pan is not Brown and Tinkerbell is not black, stop this nonsense now"
9579,CqVqvI9heT6,peter pan looks terrible.. great casting choices disney. so woke 😢
9580,CqVqvI9heT6,why is she black like no little kid cares if they are black or  white just leave all movies as the original race was made to be.
9581,CqVqvI9heT6,"I kinda wish Disney race swapped all of the characters, made some trans, some nonbinary and the rest get a regular gender swap just to see how much more it pisses people off."
9582,CqVqvI9heT6,@moorefromme @meg.wright27 watch party?????
9583,CqVqvI9heT6,@estefania.luna24  vamos ?
9584,CqVqvI9heT6,@x_olivia.gracee
9585,CqTEFIOraTL,Ends with execute order 66.😂
9586,CqTEFIOraTL,I’m just here for the Order 66 comments
9587,CqTEFIOraTL,"Oh boy, I have a bad feeling about this…"
9588,CqTEFIOraTL,Yep just like Andor we know how it ends
9589,CqTEFIOraTL,Not grown ass adults complaining for a children show 🤦🏻 Get a life
9590,CqTEFIOraTL,Its gonna suck when Anakin shows up in the season finale😢
9591,CqTEFIOraTL,I really hope that everything in the show is canon just so that all the omega Star Wars heads have to sit through the whole thing lmao
9592,CqTEFIOraTL,Idk why people are mad at the idea of this show. It’s. For. CHILDREN!!
9593,CqTEFIOraTL,No God please no
9594,CqTEFIOraTL,They should of made this into live action series
9595,CqTEFIOraTL,Well we all know how this ends 🫣
9596,CqTEFIOraTL,"I’m here for all the adults complaining, who asked for this, about a Disney Junior show clearly aimed for kids."
9597,CqTEFIOraTL,This is a season finale I can get behind
9598,CqTEFIOraTL,High Republic!!!!!!
9599,CqTEFIOraTL,Get outa here
9600,CqTEFIOraTL,Season finale better have Anakin .
9601,CqTEFIOraTL,This is so awful
9602,CqTEFIOraTL,"It’s supossed to be set 200 years before Anakin. So we get Yoda, but everyone else is new and safe from order 66. Unless we get a 250 year old Jedi Master Nubs showing up to save the day in Mandalorian lol."
9603,CqTEFIOraTL,In the end they get to meet anakin
9604,CqTEFIOraTL,Can't wait to watch order 66 again
9605,CqTEFIOraTL,*anakin skywalker has joined the chat*
9606,CqTEFIOraTL,Spoiler: They ALL die... 🤣
9607,CqTEFIOraTL,Spoiler Alert no one survives 😈😈
9608,CqTEFIOraTL,Piotr michael as Yoda?! Sign me up!!! So awesome! He is an amazing comedian. Check out his YouTube for all his star wars voices. STOKED
9609,CqTEFIOraTL,Everyone relax. 😂 Those are high republic robes. This is probably hundreds of years before order 66.
9610,CqTEFIOraTL,*Cough Cough* Order 66 *Cough Cough*
9611,CqTEFIOraTL,Not to spoil everyone's Order 66 jokes but it's High Republic era. These kids would have likely died of old age before Anakin was born.
9612,CqTEFIOraTL,Is the finale Order 66?
9613,CqTEFIOraTL,Awwww what an adorable secret to keep from my 7 year old!
9614,CqTEFIOraTL,"This is for kids, not us. My toddler will absolutely LOVE this"
9615,CqTEFIOraTL,Wtf? Bye
9616,CqTEFIOraTL,If this show doesn’t end with Anakin killing them all I’ll consider it pointless
9617,CqTEFIOraTL,❤️
9618,CqTEFIOraTL,"""thIS lOoks sO bAD"" Yeah, well no shit, it's made for kids, not  you."
9619,CqTEFIOraTL,Is it cannon tho
9620,CqTEFIOraTL,Ahhh! Cant wait to show this to my students during lunch
9621,CqTEFIOraTL,"If order 66 isn’t at the series finale, we riot"
9622,CqTEFIOraTL,looking forward to seeing them in order 66😂
9623,CqTEFIOraTL,THIS YES PLEASE WOW
9624,CqTEFIOraTL,"I really hope Disney haven’t made any of the charterers: 

Trans 
Gay 
Bi 
Drag queens 
Non binary 
Or any other crap to push an agenda on to children whilst pandering to the woke mob of danger toxic people"
9625,CqTEFIOraTL,Nah
9626,CqTEFIOraTL,@issaa_91
9627,CqTEFIOraTL,@iamrandi
9628,CqTEFIOraTL,@ksherin oh yes
9629,CqTEFIOraTL,@taylorbush21 Jase will probably love this
9630,CqTEFIOraTL,Such a sweet surprise! Really looking forward to sharing Star Wars with my baby and that it’s set in The High Republic era. May 4 is going to be extra special this year ❤️ @starwars
9631,CqTEFIOraTL,@claesisabelle @ash_ley_n
9632,CqTEFIOraTL,@laura.momof2sons Dit is misschien wel iets voor Chris en James

9634,CqTEFIOraTL,💩
9635,CqS_TnXrjFA,"Episode 4, Kenobi said Vader hunted down and killed the Jedi. It’s mostly the Inquisitors that have been hunting Jedi. Will Vader show up later on?"
9636,CqS_TnXrjFA,Looks likes Denzel Washington 😮
9637,CqS_TnXrjFA,Great episode 🙌
9638,CqS_TnXrjFA,"Any hope for a quick romance , flirt .. something… Ahsoka Tano! We all want bit of that, without losing the action ."

9640,CqS_TnXrjFA,I didn't realize it was Ahmed Best until the credits rolled when I first saw this episode! 🤣🤣🤣 What a way for him to redeem himself here after getting a lot of backlash playing Jar Jar in the Prequels! Good for him! 🙂👏

9646,CqS_TnXrjFA,👏🔥
9647,CqS_TnXrjFA,"Imma just say it: as a prequel kid, Jar Jar was one of my favorite characters (still have a soft spot for him) growing up and seeing Ahmed as a Jedi makes him even cooler. 💙"
9648,CqS_TnXrjFA,😍😍😍😍
9649,CqS_TnXrjFA,So so so so happy for him ❤️
9650,CqS_TnXrjFA,The character posters I’ve been waiting for!! 🔥🔥🔥🙌

9668,CqS_TnXrjFA,What about we make The Story of Kelleran Beq and Grogu? Do you suppose Paz Vizsla is a family member of Pre Vizsla of something that I might have to guess.
9669,CqS_TnXrjFA,🫶🤍🤍🫶
9670,CqS_TnXrjFA,👏
9671,CqS_TnXrjFA,"Never watch any Star Wars until I was in my 40’s, I am glad I didn’t listen to my friend to skip the prequel."
9672,CqS_TnXrjFA,Tha goat
9673,CqS_TnXrjFA,Jedi Kelleran Beq character poster is SO 🔥 @themandalorian
9674,CqS_TnXrjFA,No Jar Jar.  I’m sorry.

9676,CqS_TnXrjFA,Seems like Din Djarin isn’t the only person being redeemed this season 😅❤️👏🏻😁👍🏻

9776,CqL5ubShNGz,Show sucks so far
9777,CqL5ubShNGz,WHY IS HE STILL IN THE SHOW??? The novelty has worn off and Grogu had the perfect send off in S2 he literally has no place being with Din anymore other than fan service and to sell MERCH. He should be training with Luke in his new Jedi order to be destroyed in the Sequels by Kylo and his chosen Kinghts. Grogu will outlive Din at some point going off Yoda's life span if Grogu's not to be killed so what's the point...
9778,CqL5ubShNGz,Yea I know he’s Grogu but he’s my Baby Yoda 🥰such a cutie ☺️
9779,CqL5ubShNGz,Every episode is worse than the last...
9780,CqL5ubShNGz,this season sucks
9781,CqL5ubShNGz,The Last of Us is better
9782,CqL5ubShNGz,His face when he had the PTSD trigger again. Oh so sad
9783,CqL5ubShNGz,"Grogu belongs with Luke to train as a Jedi not with these Mandalorian. It’s wasted talent. Grogu is not a child, he’s just traumatized and Din is not his father. It’s nonsense with this story line."
9784,CqL5ubShNGz,"We're halfway in and still no Gideon, and only one sequence with empire. Wtf"
9785,CqL5ubShNGz,Still great show
9786,CqL5ubShNGz,I know it can sound stupid but I was never laughing at any scene more than at this one
9787,CqL5ubShNGz,Everyone's mad at the Titular Character 😂
9788,CqL5ubShNGz,Les épisodes sont vraiment top.... mais beaucoup trop courts...
9789,CqL5ubShNGz,She’s grogu’s mom
9790,CqL5ubShNGz,"Joke episodes, from 30 min, just 23 min of something to watch.... from 40 to 50 min in first season or second we now have 25 min🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
And only thing what i can watch... not so many things to see like on netflix..."

9801,CqL5ubShNGz,Awesome he is.
9802,CqL5ubShNGz,👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
9803,CqL5ubShNGz,I really hope Grogu completes his destiny to become a Jedi and restore the order. This being a mando is dumb. Makes no sense at all. Let’s hope S3 is going to get better

9912,CqA-SohP7BP,This IS gonna loop back into Grogu and Mando….right?
9913,CqA-SohP7BP,The only purpose of this episode was to advertise future treats that they’ll most likely be selling in Disneyland pretty soon! Anyone else notice how much screen time they gave to those popsicles and space biscuits?
9914,CqA-SohP7BP,So for everyone who saw the episode does it mean that Peli Moto is still working for the empire even after the reconditioning she went thru? Or maybe she didn't now that I think about it.
9915,CqA-SohP7BP,So for everyone who saw the episode does it mean that Peli Moto is still working for the empire even after the reconditioning she went thru? Or maybe she didn't now that I think about it.
9916,CqA-SohP7BP,Bad Batch is better😂 legit
9917,CqA-SohP7BP,It was a filler episode...every series you can come up with has them. 🤦🏾
9918,CqA-SohP7BP,This comment section is crazy. That was a great episode.
9919,CqA-SohP7BP,Why would a 8 episode show have a filler episode? My guess this is the guy who cloned Palpatine. Are they really trying to fix rise of Skywalker? We don't care.
9920,CqA-SohP7BP,"Everyone out here complaining that Mando is barely in it when he got episodes about him in a show about Boba Fett (and Boba Fett isn't even in one of them). People calling it filler and boring but when it starts to lead something, they're quick to get in on it and when it concludes into something awesome, they're all clapping and cheering. God forbid we get character development, world building, the potential to set up for future events, a viewpoint of how even the good guys aren't all goody two shoes, etc. But if it has no Mando, lightsabers, Force, dogfights then it equals to being bad. I swear some of y'all are freakin spoiled."
9921,CqA-SohP7BP,Two of these people make me feel strange and unbearably uncomfortable.
9922,CqA-SohP7BP,Sorry Disney but that last episode was really bad.
9923,CqA-SohP7BP,Tbh this episode was awful and boring. Hope we get more Mando from now on
9924,CqA-SohP7BP,The first bad Episode in the whole Series
9925,CqA-SohP7BP,It was ehh
9926,CqA-SohP7BP,I actually skipped half the episode and missed nothing
9927,CqA-SohP7BP,That episode was about biscuits
9928,CqA-SohP7BP,It’s a trap Dr. Penn!!!
9929,CqA-SohP7BP,Worst episode
9930,CqA-SohP7BP,This felt like a Andor ep 😴

9932,CqA-SohP7BP,that scientist sucks 1/10 episode
9933,CqA-SohP7BP,Star Wars fans doing what they do best. Complain about Star Wars…😂
9934,CqA-SohP7BP,I can’t believe people hated the first episode that actually advances the cloning plotline
9935,CqA-SohP7BP,Worst episode of the entire series so far. SMH.
9936,CqA-SohP7BP,"30% Mandalorian, 50% Prequals, 20% epilogue 😂😂😂"
9937,CqA-SohP7BP,"Slow pacing, boring dialog and a story that could have been done in all of 10 mins instead of an entire episode with one character that doesn't matter and one who was so uninteresting and stale to watch it was hard to keep attention. I get that people like the episode, and if you did, I'm happy for you glad it hit with some people, but this was one of the bottom three episodes of the Mando/Boba TV series at least from my interest levels."
9938,CqA-SohP7BP,The haters are wild. This is amazing content and lore of things we haven’t seen before. What happens to the empire after the fall…where do those people go what do they do…this is setting up the first order and cloning palp and so much more
9939,CqA-SohP7BP,My favorite part of this episode it was when it ended
9940,CqA-SohP7BP,anyone who calls this a filler episode. define filler and write me a 3 paragraph essay on how this was filler and then I’ll hear you out
9941,CqA-SohP7BP,To me the whole season so far has been boring and the last episode was just creepy.
9942,CqA-SohP7BP,How is it a filler episode seriously people are so crazy
9943,CqA-SohP7BP,"This episode started great, then it went into something no one cares about. It was so boring. Worst episode of the series by far."

*Moff Gideon appears out of nowhere, zero explanation whatsoever*

Also the crazy lunatics: IT MADE NO SENSE! There’s no build up, no backstory, NOTHING! Worst episode ever!!!

Seriously this fandom’s got one of the most self-entitled people ever. Let Jon lead it and you just watch it or stop subscribing, simple."

10027,Cp4cRyduBMJ,Daredevil was the best thing about this show unfortunately. And bringing the Abomination back.
10028,Cp4cRyduBMJ,This show did so badly because they hired writers who themselves admitted have no knowledge of how to write court scenes. That's so unprofessional and complacent. I hope the Daredevil show doesn't receive similar treatment.

10036,Cp4cRyduBMJ,Season 1 was a good first try. Now I’m really looking to be blown away for season 2. You can do it.
10037,Cp4cRyduBMJ,Without posting this shit just try to work hard on VFX category 🙂🙂
10038,Cp4cRyduBMJ,My favorite thing marvel ever did 😢
10039,Cp4cRyduBMJ,Wasted potential
10040,Cp4cRyduBMJ,All the real Marvel comics fans and readers loved She-Hulk. It was the most comic accurate show to date. Felt like I was watching a version of John Byrne’s She-Hulk. We definitely want a season 2 regardless of what the casuals and “writing” experts whine about. #isaidwhatisaid #comeatmebro
10041,Cp4cRyduBMJ,"Despite on how much hate for this series, just being cringy and awkward, y’all should know that this is the most comic book accurate one in the mcu, all the thing she does in the show is what she does in the comics, from breaking the fourth wall to jumping out of the page/screen to talk to the writers about creating a better story, also yes she doesn’t twerk but not a bad as what she did in the comics, do yourself a flavor and look the controversial issue where she’s jump roping while being naked"
10042,Cp4cRyduBMJ,"She was great but her show sucked, hope those writers never come back."
10043,Cp4cRyduBMJ,Gosto de vcs mas isso é muito ruim não continuem

10046,Cp4cRyduBMJ,Thank god they're not making Season 2
10047,Cp4cRyduBMJ,Dont ruin st pattys day for me
10048,Cp4cRyduBMJ,Show was terrible and anyone who says it wasnt is on serious copium
10049,Cp4cRyduBMJ,"You can literally could put Yoda, but no…"
10050,Cp4cRyduBMJ,"Not surprised a lot of individuals are already leaving hate comments about She-Hulk. Plenty of people simply don’t like the show because it’s not for them which is completely valid, but if you feel the need to hate comment I ask why put that type of energy towards being so hateful when you’re better off putting that energy towards being positive about the stuff you do enjoy?? There’s lots of shows and movies I hate but if I see a post about them I just ignore it and move on. Life is more enjoyable that way. We got a short time on this planet, why not use that time putting more good into the world instead of trying to bring down people who happen to enjoy something we don’t? Just something to think about. Sure I’ll get threats and insults for this comment but that’s to be expected lol."

With the logic streaming services are employing these days, I doubt beloved shows like The Office or Breaking Bad would have survived if they were released in a post- streaming world.

10142,Cp0g3TMh0L1,"The Willow show stunk. Disney dropped the ball on it like they did with the Star Wars sequels. Willow was on his way to become a great wizard in the movie but in the show we get him being unsure of his own abilities and afraid as well as taking a position as a supporting character. There were no light-hearted moments in the show unlike the movie. The terrible music covers were very out of place. To me, they tried too hard to be cool and hip for younger audiences while ignoring the older fans that have been around since the movie released. It was disappointing. Leaving the show on a cliffhanger is fine because they’d screw it up anyways."
10143,Cp0g3TMh0L1,Renew Willow 👏
10144,Cp0g3TMh0L1,So you’ll throw out an old show like this but cancel Willow after one season and cliffhanger? Okay…

I hope there’s more to come in this little series! I love the women in Black Panther and the culture of Wakanda that’s been influenced through other cultures!

Look how they obey their master China when they had to reduce Finn's face size on a star wars poster for China because China is racist.  Or how they use rainbow colors on their Disney US account in June but won't in China or Middle East accounts because they're against gays.  All pandering and you sheep eat it up.

10950,CpObuTpBXQg,I recently upgraded to the Meta Quest pro and it's mind blowing. Is there anyone that might interested in my old Quest 2 since I am not into it any longer? I'm letting go at a giveaway price if you can cover the shipping cost

11001,CpNs0izJdUG,Why two girls are lost children??? It's the only thing that doesn't make sense at all...
11002,CpNs0izJdUG,"2003 version will always be goat, like wth is this?"
11003,CpNs0izJdUG,Pls. Lets start making movies that arent based on movies or stories that other people have already made.
11004,CpNs0izJdUG,Just put the 2003 version on Disney+
11005,CpNs0izJdUG,How did Steven Spielberg's Hook look more like the Disney version than the actual Disney Captain Hook?
11006,CpNs0izJdUG,another one of peter pan how many are they 😂😂😂😂😂
11007,CpNs0izJdUG,They stripped their iconic Peter Pan movie of everything that made it great to make this happen.
11008,CpNs0izJdUG,You guys need to make more animated Disney fairy movies!🧚🏽‍♀️We never got to see how tinkerbell met Peter 😭😭
11009,CpNs0izJdUG,we dont need more remakes
11010,CpNs0izJdUG,Why Peter look 8 and Wendy looks 20
11011,CpNs0izJdUG,Yeah… going to take a hard pass on this one Disney! Maybe… just maybe… we come up with ORIGINAL content instead of remaking everything under your woke ideology. Thanks!
11012,CpNs0izJdUG,Again another movie nobody asked for
11013,CpNs0izJdUG,This doesn't really look good...
11014,CpNs0izJdUG,Is Weddy a grown woman and petter 12 good grief
11015,CpNs0izJdUG,The actress playing Tinkerbell looks NOTHING like Tinkerbell.  At all.
11016,CpNs0izJdUG,We don't need 3000 remakes of peter pan wtf
11017,CpNs0izJdUG,Disney + is so disapointing
11018,CpNs0izJdUG,"We don't need nor do we want this remake. Disney needs to stop!!!!!!!!!!!! By the way, it's Iridessa on a gree dress, not Tinkerbell. Make some sense Disney."
11019,CpNs0izJdUG,Haaaaa nope
11020,CpNs0izJdUG,Pedro Pan! 👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽
11021,CpNs0izJdUG,Yay … another Peter Pan
11022,CpNs0izJdUG,for this peter pan NO...
11023,CpNs0izJdUG,This looks like a bad fan made movie💀
11024,CpNs0izJdUG,Not hating but why do we need ANOTHER Peter Pan? Oh thats right yall have no creativity anymore
11025,CpNs0izJdUG,Should have made a PIXIE HALLOW MOVIE instead
11026,CpNs0izJdUG,Aight who asked for this?
11027,CpNs0izJdUG,"Seriously? How many different versions and reiterations of Peter Pan do we need? And Tinkerbell has been my favorite for over 40 yrs, so for me to say enough is enough, you know it's overkill."
11028,CpNs0izJdUG,Peter Pakistan
11029,CpNs0izJdUG,Please don’t make this woke Disney😭😭🙏🙏🙏
11030,CpNs0izJdUG,OHHH THE ORIGINALITY 😂
11031,CpNs0izJdUG,This looks like a fan poster of a shit movie
11032,CpNs0izJdUG,"Please don’t be woke, please don’t be woke"
11033,CpNs0izJdUG,Oh no….
11034,CpNs0izJdUG,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
11035,CpNs0izJdUG,🤦🏼‍♀️ruining my fav Disney movie since I was 4…… kk
11036,CpNs0izJdUG,Ready for an adventure? Only if its non-woke!
11037,CpNs0izJdUG,Mmmmm nah 90s and 2004 is the best. Stop remaking flims just because you are running out of ideas 🙄🤦‍♀️
11038,CpNs0izJdUG,"Oh look, another woke Disney movie I won’t watch."
11039,CpNs0izJdUG,This is a god awful title
11040,CpNs0izJdUG,"This is depressing, dark and pitiful. What's new."
11041,CpNs0izJdUG,Go woke - get broke
11042,CpNs0izJdUG,Yeah because Pinnochio did soooo welll
11043,CpNs0izJdUG,All these reboots man 👎
11044,CpNs0izJdUG,2003 peter pan is the only good one
11045,CpNs0izJdUG,"PAN was already enough, we don't need another one."
11046,CpNs0izJdUG,Why don’t they just keep the original color of the characters. Wtf is this crap
11047,CpNs0izJdUG,Peter pan looks like Mowgli
11048,CpNs0izJdUG,"Jesus, another bad Remake, you need to stop, I'm a big fan of Peter Pan, he is my favorite Disney character, but this got me worried 😟"
11049,CpNs0izJdUG,He doesn't look like a Peter Pan 🥴 and wth happened to captain hook..? Grey hair 🤢

11255,CpIoj2ZN2Op,Interesting how Disney celebrates Black History Month (nothing wrong with that) but as someone has already mentioned when it comes to selling movies to China all the advertising posters they reduce the size of black characters on said posters (Finn in Star Wars. Was a major character I thought)

11378,CpDYoGAhOWT,The comments are all fake and scams 😂
11379,CpDYoGAhOWT,These ppl all lock like they are 25 and are playing high schoolers
11380,CpDYoGAhOWT,Milo is in his 30s and has kids.  Little old to still be in high school
11381,CpDYoGAhOWT,Does this have anything to do with Pretty in Pink? Looks very 80's and the dude is dressed like Duckie
11382,CpDYoGAhOWT,Romantic comedies are that one genre of film that literally every single idea has been done to death a million times
11383,CpDYoGAhOWT,😂😂😂😂😂 what a huge waste of time 😂😂😂😂😂😂
11384,CpDYoGAhOWT,So Payton Elizabeth Lee and Milo Are both in Prom pact and also in Payton Elizabeth Lee's Hawaii doctor show.
11385,CpDYoGAhOWT,But what about the weekenders????????
11386,CpDYoGAhOWT,They getting that bag
11387,CpDYoGAhOWT,Most Disney+ movies suck.
11388,CpDYoGAhOWT,"Duckie, Andie, and Blane?"

11392,CpDYoGAhOWT,I’m sorry but This looks bad.. 😅
11393,CpDYoGAhOWT,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold"
11394,CpDYoGAhOWT,Why they try to look like pretty in pink?
11395,CpDYoGAhOWT,Bro looks like duckie
